# Cobra Imperium

![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patch-concept.png-"Patch-concept.png"){width="220" height="220"}The **_Cobra Imperium_** was one of the oldest standing factions still active in Galaxy. The **Cobra Imperium** has caused the destruction of many ships during the course of its long and complicated history. While currently dormant due to the leader being banned and the next 2 elected leaders quitting soon after they took the position, there are currently efforts to recentralize this semi dissolved faction and hopes it will be fully active soon. contributed: [Python]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Python), [Avenger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avenger)
