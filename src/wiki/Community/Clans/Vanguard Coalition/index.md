## Story

Vanguard Coalition was founded by Jay4444444444 (_also known as Nevadan)_ in 2017. The clan first started off as a group of friends who would play Galaxy together, but quickly rose to have many members, a lot of which were well known and feared by the community.

The elite division of VC, similar in concept to [.SU]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}.SU) (.skill urself), were on an [Imperator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Imperator), [Prototype class ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes), and [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios), to which they started a rampage on August 1st, 2019. They destroyed over 619~ **million** [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) (adjusted to inflation) worth of [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) in less than five months. Among the losses are 12 [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris)-Class [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) (2 not inside this time period), 12 [Prototype X-1s]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), 7 [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2)'s, a [Skeletal Ghostealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Skeletal-Ghostealis) and 35+ [Lucifers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer).
