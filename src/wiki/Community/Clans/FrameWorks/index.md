## History

FrameWorks was initially founded back in 2019 by an IPad player and originated in a small Discord Group Groupchat. FrameWorks remained somewhat prevalent for a while back in Beta, but ultimately became a shell of it's former strength due to game changes including the Gamma Phase of Galaxy.
