## Introduction

**_VOID_** is a Galaxy clan that puts a large emphasis non-toxicity and does not have a large emphasis on [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) kills.

## Story

**VOID** was originally a clan founded in August/September 2022, but it was small and somewhat irrelevant. It's achievements and history have been lost to time. Then in November of 2022, _108_Piggies_ and _SD_N45_ re-founded the clan and it's discord server under it's previous name.[^1]

<!-- -->

- **VOID** has rivalries with 'Azure Undead' and 'The Protectors' [^7], and members of 'The Protectors' hunt **VOID** members.[^8]
