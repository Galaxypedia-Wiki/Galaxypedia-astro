## The Aqua Order

The Aqua Order was once a very small branch of the Infamous Nativus faction. Due to the inactivity of the other branches, the Aqua Order split apart to become its very own faction. It grew to become very powerful, amassing a stunning 150 members at its height. Due to inactivity, the faction has become doormat. Stiil, you may see some of the old Aqua members roaming around the galaxy from time to time...
