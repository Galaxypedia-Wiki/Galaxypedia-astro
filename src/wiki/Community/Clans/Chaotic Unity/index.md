# Chaotic Unity

**Chaotic Unity** was originally founded on June 2nd, 2019 by its leaders, [Xentheta](https://www.roblox.com/users/118530577/profile), [SmokeyJoe38](https://www.roblox.com/users/91712810/profile), [Shuoll](https://www.roblox.com/users/36099269/profile), and [KasiusXIV](https://www.roblox.com/users/696650312/profile). Once Kryuvian Members, the founders of **Chaotic Unity** rebelled against the once powerful **[Kryuvian Empire]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kryuvian-Empire)** and forced the **Kryuvian Empire** into a state of abandonment, never to be seen again. **Chaotic Unity** stood to serve as a mercenary group out to hire, but was fierce in defending their allies, and accepted everyone's cultures, even their enemies'. Chaotic unity had 4 leaders of what was called the **High Council**, each Councilman having their own role to play in running the faction. SmokeyJoe38 controlled diplomacy, Shuoll controlled the many war fleets of CU, Xentheta controlled CU economy, and KasiusXIV controlled recruitment.

### Disbandment

After a relatively short run from its formation in 2019 to the release of the [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner) in spring of 2020 and its participation in several high-key Galaxy tournaments, many of the members fell inactive. This can be partially attributed to the drama facing the community at the time, as well as the leadership collapse of CU. Near the beginning of 2020, Shuoll quit Galaxy, becoming inactive on the CU High Council. Luckily, this leadership gap was able to be somewhat filled by the remaining three High Council members, as Shuoll had been mostly inactive on galaxy anyway. However, the gap would be unable to be filled when the leadership became rather weak. After participating in a tournament alongside its ally the [Aqua Order]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqua-Order), the **Chaotic Unity** leadership became more hands off and inactive. In turn, CU started losing its already limited number of experienced members to other clans that were becoming increasingly relevant such as [Lost Souls]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lost-Souls). By the release of the [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner) shortly after the start of the Covid-19 lockdown, most of the remaining members had either gone inactive or played very little, and the High Council had lost motivation to push for it otherwise. All of these factors ultimately led to a 2-1 decision between the remaining High Council members to disband **Chaotic Unity**, only a few months after the release of its flagship carrier.

### Shipyard

**Chaotic Unity** ships are constructed using advanced orb technology, as well as technology salvaged from the old **Kryuvian Empire**. The [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner) is one such ship.
