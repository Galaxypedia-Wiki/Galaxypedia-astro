Well known Galaxy Community Member & Developer. Mostly known for his role in causing the [Enigma Cache Incident]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Enigma-Cache-Incident). He is also known for trolling in the Galaxy Discord Server.

## Story

PataNautic started playing Galaxy in 2015 on a different account, but has been playing on his main account (PataNautic) since 2018. Pata became a modeller for Galaxy at an unspecified date but estimated a few months prior to the events of the [Enigma Cache Incident]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Enigma-Cache-Incident). After developers Juice and GalaxyOrigins were demoted by rcouret ("rc") for "inactivity", rc did not want any new developers for a while. Eventually the Galaxy Community convinced him to let Pata be a developer, in which Pata was ranked to developer. Pata started to push out updates that the community longed for. Eventually Pata would release an update which started the events known as the [Enigma Cache Incident]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Enigma-Cache-Incident) and resulted in his demotion from developer. Pata would go to regain his developer rank in early 2022.
