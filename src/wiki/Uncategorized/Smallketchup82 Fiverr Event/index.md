On January 8th, 2022, the Galaxy Developer smallketchup82 went onto fiverr and paid someone $10 CAD to read out a Galaxy Copypasta. The video features an African American male with a Nigerian accent reading out the copypasta, then sobbing afterwards.

The copypasta:

> "Hey can someone tell me why my ship died here: We were attaking a base, with a proto x-1, a couple liegionarres, a tenna, and my apoc. The other team's x-1 spesifically targets my apoc, and I warp like three times away from them, and they keep chasing me to my death. why me?"

smallketchup82 had said that him and another Galaxy Developer, XxChaoticStrike were actually planning on doing this for a while but didn't have the money to do so. They wanted to have BigManTyrone being the one to read out the copypasta, but it would've cost $60 CAD and they weren't able to afford that. So instead smallketchup82 opted to just pay some random guy on fiverr to read it out.
