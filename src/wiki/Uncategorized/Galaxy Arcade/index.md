# Overview

![centre|Galaxy Arcade
Icon](Galaxy_Arcade.png "centre|Galaxy Arcade Icon") **Galaxy Arcade** is a more new-player friendly version of Galaxy. Players start off with 7500 credits and can earn more. Credits save, allowing one to earn abnormal amounts of money and leaving, without it resetting to 7500c. Most [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) are free to buy, so you don't have to earn anything and can fly without fear of losing your ship. Players may build all ships though the Cruiser class without a gamepass, all ships of higher classes require ROBUX-bought gamepasses to build. [VIP Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}vip-ships) of any class can be bought at half price. Previously, this was not the case, as VIP ships were able to be bought for free as long as you own the gamepass. Also previously, players could buy 4 battlecruisers for free; [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova), [Bastion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bastion), [Belvat]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Belvat), and [Dire Wolf]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dire-Wolf). Permit ships act as normal ships, costing a permit and materials to build and do not cost a gamepass. Gamepass prices were recently increased by around 5% at the start of Gamma phase. **Galaxy Arcade** is stuck at the very end of Gamma phase. UNE does not spawn, which can cause issues with quests.

The map in **Galaxy Arcade** is a lot smaller than in Galaxy, and the game is limited to five [player factions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) instead of the usual ten.

**Galaxy Arcade** is easier to grind in for one reason; bounty grinding. Bounty grinding is where you nuke a lot of high-cost miners/freighters to an alt. When your alt has enough bounty, you kill your alt until it is drained of bounty, giving you heaps of credits.

Some people say **Galaxy Arcade** isn't fun because of "Pay-to-Win kids", as all [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) cost ROBUX. However, **Galaxy arcade** can be nice if you want to fight without fear of losing expensive ships, and can be useful for testing new updates, new ship mechanics, taking screenshots, etc.
