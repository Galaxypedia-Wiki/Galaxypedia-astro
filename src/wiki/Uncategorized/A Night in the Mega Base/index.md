title: A Night in the Mega Base
---

A piece of NSFW literature written by the former Galaxy admin Shuoll. This literature describes a fictional and in-depth interaction between several famous Galaxy players such as Falloria and s0phie. This piece of literature sparked many a few laughs for how stupidly descriptive it was at describing the event unfolding in the Mega Base.

At the time it sparked quite a heavy reaction from the community and has since become and inside joke between everyone who has ever blessed their soul with the contents of the book. Because of the way Galaxy (+ ROBLOX & Galaxy Discord) censor things, it is considered NSFW and therefore to post any link or descriptions of what happens in the story would be moderated. But many members have access to recordings of the former Galaxy admin MinisterKappa reading **A Night in the Mega Base**.
