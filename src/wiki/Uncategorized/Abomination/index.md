The **L科科約科科約希吉科約希吉約希希吉科約希吉約希吉**, otherwise known as the **Abomination** is a [Titan]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}titans) class ship.

## Description

Little is known about this ship. 0ctav1on, xXjunhanXx, and DylanTheVillain101 are the only confirmed owners of this ship.

## Appearance

Like its nickname suggests, it is an abomination of a ship. It is made up of random parts from a lot of ships including [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus), [M Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}M-Class), [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon), and more. Most of the teleporters and interiors of the ships that make up of the Abomination are removed, with the Astraeus in the center being an exception to this. Two Xeenophiles can be seen at the top, as well as fifteen Bubbleshields stacked on top of each other. While the Xeenophiles could be piloted by players and AI, Bubbleshields lack accessible pilot seats and are therefore exclusive to being controlled by AI. The pilot seat is located inside the Astraeus in its usual location.

## Advantages

- Armed with 15 stacked Bubbleshields, which can soak up a total of 4k health each.
- The Abomination's and its fighters' large size are useful for tanking incoming damage for a base from fighters and sieges alike.
- Incredibly fast and agile.
- Near impossible to die with it, even when fired at by multiple Prototypes. With its 75% damage resistance, Bubbleshield fighters, and 70k total health, it would take an entire clan worth of Prototypes to even stand a chance at killing it.

## Disadvantages

- This is an incredibly rare ship and is likely to be hunted (albeit, with little chance of success).
- Extremely large, larger than most Super Capitals. It is very hard to miss this ship with turrets and spinals, even with the high mobility.
- Once you lose it, you can never get it back.
- No method of damaging others.

## Strategy

- Use the Abomination's and its Bubbleshield fighters' hitboxes to completely surround and protect a base from siege.

## Trivia

- The only confirmed owners of this ship are 0ctav1on (formerly known as teentitansgohomee, one of the developer team members), and DylanTheVillain101, who received it to partake in a "trolling session" with 0ctav1on.
- When first released, the Abomination was armed with 10 Bubbleshields and 4 real [Xenophiles]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xenophile). While it sounded funny initially, this lead a curious Dylan to attempt to destroy an actual ship with these pitifully weak fighters. With prior consent and about 10 minutes, loudboom46's [Stealth Recon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stealth-Recon) was the first and only ship to this day to have ever been killed by a Xenophile after the introduction of Galaxy Info Bot during the game's gamma phase.
- Soon after the above incident, the fighters were changed to Xeenophiles, which were just Xenophiles stripped of its weaponry. On top of that, the Abomination would spawn only 2 of them rather than 4 it previously spawned. To make up for it, the number of Bubbleshields were increased to from 10 to 15, along with numerous stat adjustments.
- Attempting to use /info command on this ship will result in scrambled data.
- Although a total of 15 turrets can be seen on the ship, none of them can be fired.
- This ship has the same ambience as [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) and [Abaddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abaddon). Both of them play at random intervals.
- Even though this ship is classified as a [Titan]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}titans), it is almost nothing more than a harmless ship.
- No longer spawnable in-game.
