The **\*Lykan**'' was the fighter of the [carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers),**\*[Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos)**'' which was going to be awarded to the first-place winner of the Galaxy Tournament?

# Description

The Lykan is believed to be the fighter of the carrier, [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos), it had mediocre firepower, durability and good speed? It would have been comparable to the [Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Brawler)? All of this information was found when user, HyperBlue_EonBeta was investigation the ship [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos) using the /info command ingame, he misspelled [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos) and was greeted with the Lykan instead. The [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos) had a singular unknown fighter. It could be inferred that the Lykan is the fighter of the [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos) because of the similarity of the name (only a one letter difference) as well as the fact that when the information for the [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos) was removed ingame, the information for the Lykan was also removed. If this is true then the Lykan will never be in game because of the cancelation of the Galaxy Tournament.

# Trivia

- Only two people were going to own this; the 1st-place winner of the Galaxy Tournament, and the ship's creator, [Bomb_pops]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bomb-pops).
- Due to the cancellation of the Galaxy Tournament, the **Lykos** and [C Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}C-Class) will never be added to the game, let alone be distributed.
- Was discovered when the player _HyperBlue_EonBeta_ was investigating the ship [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos) using the /info command ingame, he misspelled [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos) and was greeted with the Lykan instead.
- Still needs to be confirmed of its existence,
