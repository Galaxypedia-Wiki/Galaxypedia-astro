## Description

The **_Cyber Prototype X-1_** is an [Admin ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) that resembles a cross between the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) and the [Cyber Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyber-Leviathan). It ran into various problems during its first addition and had to be fixed by [Rcouret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rcouret) in order to function.

Identical to the X-1 interior, although there are a few hitbox differences. Identical to Prototype X-1, but mainly red instead and there's an extra teleporter inside the interior that teleports you to the NPC spawning area only for Admins.

- Will be hunted due to it being an admin ship.
- It is among the slowest Admin ships, alongside the [Keyships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Key) and [Malice]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Malice).
- <s>LOUD</s>

## Strategy

- Show off your awesome [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) recolor to your friends.
