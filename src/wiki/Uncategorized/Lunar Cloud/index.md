## Introduction

**_Lunar Cloud_** (known as LC) is a clan that is governed by a democracy of 9 players.

## Story

**Lunar Cloud** was originally founded by _xeta_rus_ (now known as moralxeta) when they and a few other players worked together to kill a famous player. Within it's first weeks, the clan had killed millions of credits worth of ships[^1]. Sometime in early 2021 (presumably in March or April), the original founder deleted the discord.[^2]However, some of the players in that discord continued to play and keep the name and logo.[^3]. After a while of the clan only existing in the form of discord group chats[^4], the clan grew once again. Around February 2023, **Lunar Cloud** became unofficially allied with "Post Prototype Stress Disorder", and some of Post Prototype Stress Disorder's members got assimilated into **Lunar Cloud**.[^5]

As of the time of writing, there is 9 "Core Members" of **Lunar Cloud**, and power over the clan is split equally between these 9 people. In 2022, the clan got many kills, including (but not limited to) 6 [Protoype X-1s]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), 2 [Protoype X-2s]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), 6 [Lucifers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer), and 4 [Alpha Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alpha-Ship).[^6]

## Trivia

- **Lunar Cloud** is the only clan that has gotten a [Waspinator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator) kill.[^7]
