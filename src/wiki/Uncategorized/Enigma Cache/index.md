## V1

The **Enigma Cache** is a secret quest giver for [Quest]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}quests) #89 found deep inside [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion). It is a mysterious octahedron-shaped device that gives you a quest to "activate it". The quest requires 1 Dimensional Alloy, and awards you 500K for completing it. The quest is repeatable. ![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quest89.png-"Quest89.png")

## V2

The Enigma Cache V2 is an addition for Enigma Day 2022, remembering the [incident that came prior]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Enigma-Cache-Incident). It awards 5 credits upon completion of its quest for nothing in return, and threatens the player with a ban. It keeps the original's octahedron design with a glowing white orb in its center and location in Frion's cavern.

## Trivia

- This quest has caused the demotion of 4 different admins, and brought the playerbase on the Official Galaxy Discord Server into a state of pure chaos.
