The **_Dissonance_** is a basic destroyer that is the smallest AI-controlled pirate ship in the [Halloween Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2021) event.

## Description

The **_Dissonance_** is a small destroyer that excels in swarms. It is a black and yellow ship with a large, central globe.

## Behaviour

Will detect players/enemy AI from up to around 30,000 studs away, proceeding to simply chase it until the target dies, the ship itself dies, or it loses sight of the target. Will follow the call of larger allied pirate ships, but cannot call itself.

## Loot

- 3 Souls

## Strategy

- Fight this ship in heavily point-defense based ships such as the [Loyalist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalist) or [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos). Consider using a heavier variant such as the [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest) when fighting swarms of these.
- When fighting a swarm of these in addition to a [Lament]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lament) or [Hellkeeper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hellkeeper), it is recommended to retreat to a base (assuming you are not already present at a base) and despawn your ship, as groups of these ships can be deadly.

## Version History

- No logged changes (?)

## Trivia

- The description "stop exploiting" is in reference to how the ship's statistics cannot be seen using the :info command: they can only be viewed using the Galaxy Info bot.
