+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Copypasta | <span title="Put a | | | s ??? if the creator is unknown" | | | >Creator</span> | +==================================+==================================+ | Hello everyone, a concerned dad | Samicool | | here. Recently my 16 year old | | | son discovered the movie | | | "Guardians of the Galaxy" after | | | watching it at a friends house. | | | While I didn't mind at first, it | | | soon began to affect his | | | character. Within a week, he had | | | taken a persona "rocket | | | raccoon". When asked to do his | | | homework, he called me a "stupid | | | freaking human" father and did a | | | strange dance. His grades have | | | been dropping heavily since that | | | day and whenever i refuse to | | | give him my credit card for | | | nitro he threatens me saying | | | he'll "steal my batteries". | | | Yesterday I entered his room to | | | witness him listening to | | | "Guardians of the Galaxy | | | Soundtrack 9 hour loop ", he | | | has stuffed pillows under his | | | shirt and now calls himself a | | | "Head Admin." He refuses to go | | | to school unless we "jump gate" | | | there. I don't know what that is | | | but he refuses to take any form | | | of transportation except that. | | | Please I am so concerned, what | | | do I do | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | In the case Galaxy falls from | SmokeyJoe38 | | the Exploiter attack, I'd like | | | to thank everyone for being | | | apart of the community. While we | | | all have our flaws and great | | | things, that's what brought us | | | together. We may hate each other | | | for whatever reason, but deep | | | down, all of us together are a | | | large family. A family I am | | | honored to have staff. I hope | | | galaxy isn't removed, but I | | | don't know anymore. If it is, | | | hopefully we can still chat in | | | the disc, but that's an | | | unknown. Again, thank you | | | everyone for the good memories, | | | and the bad. Godspeed, | | | | | | Jaxumi92 (SmokeyJoe38). | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Hi, I purchased a Galaxy VIP | ??? | | game pass but I didn't get my | | | galaxy, how do I request a | | | refund? Can I have my galaxy | | | back, plz. I bought the Galaxy | | | VIP pass but I do not have the | | | ship. Plz, help. I need to know | | | how to request a refund. I | | | don't know what to do anymore. | | | I really want myGalaxy back but | | | nobody is helping me, I have log | | | proof of my Galaxy VIP purchase | | | but I do not see the ship in my | | | list, I rejoined the game 5 | | | times, and had done so for the | | | past 4 days. Is Galaxy VIP a | | | scam? I want my robux refund | | | instead thanks. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | So what happens when you forget | dragoslays | | you are at war? Let me tell you | | | the tale of Dragoslays theia. A | | | true genius who worked with a | | | friend to kill a Prototype x-2. | | | In his ingenious mind, he | | | thought it would be fine to warp | | | to his friend, xICamm's base. | | | In the history of Galaxy, never | | | has there been a bigger gamma | | | moment than this. He forgot that | | | he was at war with the largest | | | team in the server and promptly | | | got dived. Succeeding to warp | | | close to his base, he docked but | | | just as he was about to spawn, | | | his hand accidentally pressed | | | the "Buy Menu" button, costing | | | him two crucial seconds. And | | | that ladies and gentlemen, is | | | what happens when you forget you | | | are at war | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | okay i actually have to explain | spaten_fisch1 (Kavstusion) | | myself people are shitting on me | | | because they think i was to | | | scared to dive the theia before | | | the x-2. thats half true and | | | half not. normally when i play | | | galaxy and kill people i think | | | about what i would do next if i | | | would be in the other peoples | | | position. if i was the theia i | | | would have warped 80k in the | | | direction of my base and then | | | warped to mega to despawn, so | | | the protos had warp cooldown and | | | i could survive. this is why i | | | waited i wanted to see if the | | | theia gamma warps or just does a | | | short warp. second, sure i was | | | scared, i had no clue if i can | | | trust shocking (xps) or if i | | | cant. if he would have awoxed me | | | i would have the green theia his | | | proto and yellow sc on me. and | | | if the theia despawned and one | | | of our people in purple spawned | | | his theia i would have died | | | without having a chance to | | | despawn | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Well maybe if they refunded my | Cheifhayden | | Hype you can destroy it again | | | some time. It was really fun | | | while it lasted . For context I | | | lost my Hyperion and Theia | | | within one day of buying them | | | because of experiences like | | | these. I guess its all apart of | | | the game LOL. Can't think of | | | any reason I should be mad at | | | this. Happy Holidays! P.S. It | | | still doesn't show in my logs | | | for whatever reason. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | I hate war. So much. I can't | spellmynameright | | keep a single god damn ship | | | because of it. In my opinion it | | | ruins the game. If anyone knows | | | of any other space-type games | | | like this one where I don't have | | | to deal with being swarmed by | | | giant war ships, feel free to | | | message me. But I don't think I | | | want to play Galaxy anymore. I'm | | | not sure why I'm telling you | | | guys this since you're probably | | | just gonna be toxic like | | | everyone else but I am anyway. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | You know what, screw this game. | | | I gave it up for a reason. I get | | | on to play for the first time in | | | months, and my Galaxy gets dock | | | blocked, and now I can't even | | | get it freaking REFUNDED? I was | | | right about this game when I | | | left, RC is driving this into | | | the ground. Screw Galaxy, screw | | | this server, and screw | | | whoever's idea it was to make | | | Galaxy non-refundable | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Hi, I am a player of your Roblox | 7DavidB | | game, Galaxy, and it has come to | | | my attention that the Nimitz has | | | not been added back into the | | | game. After waiting for a large | | | amount of time, I have run out | | | of patience. A few months back, | | | I lost my Nimitz (and this was | | | during the Nimitz removal), | | | hence making me lose my Nimitz | | | forever. Also, recently before | | | the removal, I purchased this | | | carrier, but then it went off | | | sale. Now, here's a deal. I | | | PURCHASED this ship with ROBUX | | | in Galaxy Arcade, so a refund is | | | the correct course of action, as | | | the staff should have common | | | sense. A refund action would be | | | either returning my Nimitz, or | | | giving me another ship of my | | | choosing. | | | | | | If I cannot be refunded, this is | | | unacceptable, as I spent ROBUX | | | on it, which costs real money. | | | No refund would force me to quit | | | your game and report you to | | | Roblox for scamming. I will wait | | | for a response. I'm tired of | | | waiting. It's been months. | | | | | | Sincerely, David (7DavidB) | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Did you ever hear the tragedy of | Komet07_TheNew | | Darth p2wlord The stupid? I | | | thought not. It's not a story | | | the gammas would tell you. It's | | | a p2w legend. Darth p2w was a | | | Dark Lord of the bobux, so | | | powerful and so wise he could | | | use the bobux to influence rc to | | | buy credits... He had such a | | | knowledge of the dark side that | | | he could even buy scs. The dark | | | side of the bobux is a pathway | | | to many abilities some consider | | | to be unnatural. He became so | | | powerful... the only thing he | | | was afraid of was losing his | | | power, which eventually, of | | | course, he did. Unfortunately, | | | he bought everything he coukd, | | | then his debt collection agency | | | killed him in his sleep. Ironic. | | | He could buy any ship, but at a | | | price | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | I find my warning in the FOB | smallketchup82 (sugondese) | | Discord (For the game called | | | Field of Battle on the ROBLOX | | | Platform) incredibly foolish. My | | | intentions in the message were | | | to ask a simple question "Would | | | I be instantly banned in the fob | | | discord server if I were to | | | recite the word known in short | | | as the sh slur." I was given an | | | answer then given a warning by a | | | moderator, I found such harsh | | | action(s) very unwarranted as I | | | did not say the full word which | | | is not bypassing. Other people | | | (moderators I assume) who were | | | there with me had not moderated | | | me for it, as they saw that it | | | was not worth the effort to | | | moderate someone for such a | | | small infraction. But this | | | certain moderator whom moderated | | | me had done the unforgiveable; | | | moderating Sugondese who is | | | known as the Galaxy Scripter and | | | future Galaxy Owner. Why must I | | | be warned for something so | | | small? It does not make sense to | | | me. Please, madame | | | Blackprincess1, I ask that you | | | remove this warning from me as I | | | have not caused any harm to any | | | individual through my message. | | | If anything this warning has | | | caused a great deal of mental | | | suffering for me, I was shaking | | | and crying and drinking my coca | | | cola during the whole debate. | | | All in all, please remove my | | | warning. It was very | | | unwarranted. Thank you for your | | | time. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | kid. sit down mutt. i own you | Bronzidity | | breh. little boy acting tough | | | huh. boutta get smacked up fr. | | | watch your mouth child. i got | | | 0.9 more kd then you. thats | | | almost a whole ship breh. on god | | | your trash bozo. 🚬 | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | kid. sit down mutt. i own you | Bronzidity | | breh. little boy acting tough | | | huh. boutta get smacked up fr. i | | | ate yo dragon breakfast. its in | | | my carnage. wanna bet? thats a | | | whole ship breh. on god your | | | trash. combat rewards paid for | | | my meal. awoxing on the daily. | | | speak up so i can hear you. i | | | got 21m carnage total, thats 17m | | | more than you got. dont talk to | | | me. i aint dropping a sweat. | | | actual retard. shut yo mouth, | | | please. id. sit down mutt. i own | | | you breh. little boy acting | | | tough huh. boutta get smacked up | | | fr. watch your mouth child. i | | | got 0.9 more kd then you. thats | | | almost a whole ship breh. on god | | | your trash bozo. 🚬 | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | I SEE PERSONS SAID I | overfightlll | | AUTOMINED....IT'S A SHAME, I | | | HAVE FARM FOR MORE THAN 2 MONTHS | | | NOW TO PAY ME ONE OF HIS | | | MONSTERS THAT DECIMENTS PLAYERS | | | FOR YEARS ....

I | | | decided to exploit on their game | | | to automine not only uranium but | | | also i began to cryptomine sc | | | permits. It was so amazing and i | | | became the RICHEST player in | | | town until one fateful day i | | | wake up in my basement garbage | | | pile, i slither over to my 1995 | | | desktop, i boot up the computer, | | | and after having to install an | | | update that took about 17 hours | | | to install, i go to roblox.com | | | and play galaxy. But when i join | | | the game i get a little message | | | saying i was BANNED by the | | | server admins! YEP THATS RIGHT | | | BANNED! I GOT BANNED FOR SIMPLY | | | USING A FLAW IN THE GAMES CODE | | | TO MY ADVANTAGE! THIS GAME IS | | | EVIL I TELL YOU! EVIL EVIL EVIL | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Today, Halloween part 2 was | Thank you SuperChip15 for this | | released! I was so happy, and I | event, but please please nerf | | wanted to start grinding | UNE Subjugator | | immediately. I found the | | | requirements for the ships | | | online, and got out of bed. I | | | noticed something strange: all | | | of my family's ships looked | | | like humans! I realized | | | SuperChip15 must have updated | | | ships to look like your real | | | life avatar, so I relaxed. I | | | grabbed an Abbadon's Arrow from | | | the kitchen side and destroyed | | | my dog, giving me 10,000 bounty | | | and some Souls. Yes! I was | | | already on my way to making | | | Prikkit! Moving on, I quickly | | | destroyed my Gamma parents, | | | making sure to spam L as I did. | | | I also remembered the quests | | | need Forgotten Souls, so I | | | attacked my brother, and dived | | | him when he warped out the | | | window. After that, I went to | | | the turret store, but was | | | confused when all the turrets | | | looked like guns. I guessed it | | | was another SuperChip15 change | | | so I bought a Dual Heavy Railgun | | | and warped to the server's Mega | | | Base. When I arrived, I could | | | not believe how many ships were | | | there! I hastily warred them and | | | began destroying them. I | | | laughed: I couldn't wait to | | | check my logs! However, one | | | Gamma used their phone to | | | mutlibox and bait UNE to Mega | | | Base! Even though they had | | | turrets as well, I effortlessly | | | destroyed them, screaming "RIP | | | BOZO" at their wrecks, as I | | | reaped more Forgotten Souls from | | | them. Then, something | | | unbelievable happened. The UNE | | | Subjugator spawned! It said | | | something about "cease" and | | | "desist" but I didn't care, | | | because I couldn't believe they | | | added voicelines to Galaxy! When | | | I tried warping away, it fired | | | at me, destroying my ship. While | | | it was really cool, it is | | | extremely OP, and I lost many | | | souls | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Its been years and i have not | ??? | | gotten a single preos hearts, i | | | have wasted my 100 hours just to | | | get no preos hearts, its like im | | | in this game, trapped farming | | | for years just to get preos | | | heart for adult quest, im been | | | farming all night just to get | | | nothing, its like im losing | | | everything, wasting my mom's | | | credit cart just to p2w this | | | game but still no preos hearts, | | | i played this all day and i fell | | | unconscious, next day i waked up | | | at the hospital and i see hearts | | | and it looks like a ####ing | | | preos heart, im been trapped in | | | this game, farming for endless | | | hours, you cant die in this | | | game, your just gonna respawn. | | | Everyone got preos adult except | | | me, my friends are laughing at | | | me because i didnt got the preos | | | adult. Shouldnt have played this | | | game, now im stuck in this | | | endless loop of farming. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Everyone, my day is ruined. My | ! | | favourite Roblox Galaxy | | | Developer and Scripter, | | | smallketchup82 (AKA Sugondese, | | | for those less educated) has | | | committed an atrocious act. I | | | woke up this morning and rolled | | | out of my bed, then, as my | | | mother carried me into my chair | | | with great difficulty, I opened | | | Discord. I noticed that | | | smallketchup82 was hosting a | | | Fortnite livestream. At first, I | | | was overjoyed, as Fortnite is my | | | favourite game, and I love all | | | the female characters | | | especially. However, when I | | | joined the stream to see if I | | | could join smallketchup82's | | | party, I saw him taking part in | | | a horrific practice. | | | smallketchup82, the respected | | | Galaxy developer, was FINISHING | | | KNOCKED-OUT PLAYERS IN FORTNITE! | | | In outrage, I immediately | | | blocked him, and left the Galaxy | | | Discord server. I've posted my | | | story on Reddit.com and I have | | | gotten 9.7k upvotes so far. | | | smallketchup82 is a public | | | menace and I HIGHLY advise you | | | avoid him AT ALL COSTS | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Hello everyone, Rocket_GotG's | Rocket_GotG | | trusted friend, Peter Quill | | | here. Recently my pal Rocket | | | discovered the video game | | | "Galaxy Gamma" after playing | | | it in his quarters with Groot. | | | While I didn't mind at first, | | | it soon began to affect his | | | behaviour. Within a week, he had | | | been "Grinding" and yelling | | | "Die Gamma" while laughing. | | | When asked to save the galaxy, | | | he called me a "Gamma A-hole" | | | from top of his lungs and mocked | | | my dance moves. His life been | | | degrading heavily and his snarky | | | attitude grown worse, picked up | | | many fights in a bar and | | | whenever I refuse to give him my | | | Units for 'robux' he threatens | | | me saying he'll "Blast me | | | outta the Airlock with 'Gamma' | | | written on my forehead". | | | Yesterday I entered his room, | | | listening to "Galaxy Gamma | | | Combat Music", he said "Their | | | music are so much better than ya | | | choice of genre, Peter Gamma". | | | He refuses to save the galaxy | | | unless we "warp" there. Sure, | | | we're in a ship, but warp | | | isn't the same as jumping... | | | Please I am so concerned, what | | | do I do? | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Hi everyone. Worried coach here. | loudboom46 | | I run a team for under 16's in | | | football, and one of our team's | | | best players has recently become | | | hooked on a Roblocks.com game | | | named Galaxy. One night, during | | | a practice match, I came over | | | and asked him if he was okay, as | | | he was not performing as well. | | | He told me to "shut up Gamma" | | | and started shouting all about | | | "carnage", "protos" and | | | "lucy". I assume this is some | | | sort of drug, so I immediately | | | contacted the boy's parents. | | | Next training he refused to take | | | part in activities so I | | | confronted him again. He told me | | | that he wanted to switch teams | | | because his team, which he kept | | | calling his "faction", was | | | full of "Gammas" who are | | | "scared to dive the ball". He | | | then stormed off the pitch, | | | saying that "he had no | | | loyalty" anyway. After that, he | | | did not show up at any of our | | | games, telling me that "his | | | warp was on cooldown" or "he | | | was grinding for next event". | | | I'll be honest, I'm starting | | | to think this "event" is some | | | sort of gang thing, and I'm | | | thinking the boy is a lost | | | cause. Anyone know what I should | | | do? | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Hello everyone, a concerned dad | NotHyperion (?) | | here. Recently my 16 year old | | | son discovered the video game | | | "Galaxy" after playing it at a | | | friends house. While i didn't | | | mind at first, it soon began to | | | affect his character. Within a | | | week, he had taken up | | | "sieging" and "diving". When | | | asked to do his homework, he | | | called me a "gamma" father and | | | did a strange dance. His grades | | | have been dropping heavily since | | | that day and whenever i refuse | | | to give him my credit card for | | | robux he threatens me saying | | | he'll "dockblock me". | | | Yesterday I entered his room to | | | witness him listening to | | | "Galaxy Gamma Combat Music", | | | he has stuffed pillows under his | | | shirt and now calls himself an | | | "alpha." He refuses to go to | | | school unless we "warp" there. I | | | don't know what that is but he | | | refuses to take any form of | | | transportation except that. | | | Please I am so concerned, what | | | do I do? | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Guys guys devs are evil! They | It was just doing their job how | | only fix the game to break it | dare all of you guys they just | | again guys! omg guys we need to | wanted to right click some poor | | riot against the admin team they | souls! Such based I'm giving | | banned my favorite admin Purpel | this game a bad review on the | | | forums! Im a youtuber with over | | | 10m followers on youtube! Guys | | | please notice my exitance! | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Hey can someone tell me why my | ??? | | ship died here: We were attaking | | | a base, with a proto x-1, a | | | couple liegionarres, a tenna, | | | and my apoc. The other team's | | | x-1 spesifically targets my | | | apoc, and I warp like three | | | times away from them, and they | | | keep chasing me to my death. why | | | me? | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Sorry, don't speak to me until | Uglycar | | you grow up. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | okay so It's a normal day and | LightningBow128 | | I'm being my e class that I just | | | got on it's maiden voyage. I'm | | | looking around at our enemies | | | bases. no dreads, carriers or | | | supercaps just a bunch of low | | | level ships. I wrap 6k away from | | | mega and I see 1 battle ship, a | | | dread and a cruiser or a | | | destroyer. and instantly 2k away | | | from my health and I'm thinking | | | "was there a hidden super cap or | | | something?" I warp to docking | | | range already have jumped into | | | and out of my seat before | | | warping and again BOOM I'm dead. | | | I look and | | | see...supercoolgamerboy127's | | | schimitar and a solstice, dreads | | | still on there way when I see | | | supercoolgamerboy127 zip around | | | like a madman like he did while | | | his team were doing a drive on | | | our base (Sorry max words) so I | | | basically died to a schimitar | | | and a solstice in a 10k plus | | | health freighter in less then 30 | | | seconds. Im super pissed of that | | | the e class I made the same day | | | was destroyed on its maiden | | | voyage by a hacker in a | | | schimitar. If you don't believe | | | me about the hacker then ask | | | esylumcloud because he was there | | | when supercoolgamerboy was | | | speeding around our base. I'm | | | really sad about my e class and | | | I'm shure supercoolgamerboy127 | | | has destroyed a bunch of other | | | people in his schimitar already. | | | I really want my e class | | | refunded because I'm already | | | broke from making the previous | | | one. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Important news @SuperSlavMan76 | teentitansgohomee | | Is a rat (snitch) don't speak to | | | him (he will call the opps on | | | you ) | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | have you not realized that the | shooter7620 | | community that is present here | | | has already coped with the fact | | | that rc has made the game worse | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | You are worthless, bitch-ass | XxChaoticStrike | | gamma. Your life literally is as | | | valuable as a summer ant. I'm | | | just gonna stomp you, you keep | | | coming back. I'm gonna seal up | | | all my cracks, you're gonna keep | | | coming back. Why? 'cuz you keep | | | grinding for content, you | | | worthless bitch-ass gamma. | | | You're gonna grind in this game | | | until you DIE. This game serves | | | no purpose in life. Your purpose | | | in life is to be playing this | | | game, grinding for mats daily. | | | Your purpose in life is to lose | | | your ships daily. This game is | | | NOTHING. It serves ZERO purpose. | | | You should stop playing this | | | game NOW! And give your computer | | | a much better game to install | | | and play so you can enjoy a much | | | more superior game because what | | | are you here for? To worship rc? | | | STOP PLAYING THIS GAME. I mean | | | that with a hundred per cent, | | | with a THOUSAND-percent. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Dear Rocket, I'm messaging you | DylanTheVillain101(?) | | again about doman90's demotion. | | | He needs to be demoted | | | immediately today he said I | | | smelled like cheese and it | | | brought back a flashback of a | | | traumatic experience when the | | | lunch lady said "no more cheese | | | sticks left kid" it was really | | | insensitive and he knew that he | | | should have not said what he | | | said. I'd also like to report | | | Samicoo who should be insta | | | banned because of his continuous | | | support of doman90. Lastly is | | | DylanTheVillain101 I believe he | | | should be demoted and not be | | | able to run for staff again | | | after his continued support of | | | samicoo and domans insolence or | | | as they like to call it "messing | | | around" and "jokes". | | | | | | Love you, Miss SmokeyJoe | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Why do you want to even to join | InfamousZumi | | so badly, we're not even all | | | that great of a group and barely | | | kill super capitals, half of us | | | is inactive half the time | | | because of work or real life | | | issues. You're literally friend | | | and ahrii and last i checked he | | | is a well known awoxer which you | | | also took part in, in the end | | | OTG isn't even a faction it's | | | just a group of friends amongst | | | other friend that everyone feels | | | comfortable being around with | | | which I can guarantee to you, | | | absolutely no one feels | | | comfortable with you being in | | | said friend group. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Oh no, I can care less if my | InfamousZumi | | ships die by people like you, I | | | can simply rebuild it with a few | | | flicks of a wrist because I am | | | just that kind of p2w player | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | yeah but my suggestion was solid | XmasDementia | | and prototype only moderated me | | | because a dev advisor pinged him | | | too, proto never moderates | | | suggestions so i feel like this | | | was a targetted stalking and | | | moderation because proto wanted | | | to awox me | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | It's a blessing that I get to | Krampus (K1LLSHOTS) | | be in a discord server and not | | | get banned after sharing my C: | | | drive. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Hello everyone I won't be | ??? | | online for some years due to | | | some task that I have to | | | do</br>This task is a | | | bit risky and can result in me | | | never coming | | | online</br>So yeah I | | | would come online only when an | | | update is released in | | | galaxy</br>Pls don't | | | ping me during this | | | period</br>I can't say | | | how many years it is gonna | | | take</br>But lets just | | | think it is 5 years | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | I like when I join this game | spy8273 | | expecting to be able to mine | | | without getting chased by some | | | guy in a dispossable ship | | | looking for that ez kill to then | | | say "ez ez ez ez gg no re" :/ | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Are the devs trying to ruin the | ManiacalBoom | | game? WHY ARE YOU NERFING THE | | | CARRIERS THE HEALTH IS THE ONLY | | | THING THAT MAKES THEM GOOD | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | and AI wouldn't make carriers | ManiacalBoom | | busted IF THE DEVS actually PUT | | | A CAP on how many you can get | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | @rcouret hello yes can you nerf | popfloyd | | ai fighters because the | | | overabundance of full strength | | | ai fighters has resulted in the | | | biggest break in game balance | | | since turret standardization and | | | has caused carriers to be nerfed | | | into the ground so hard that | | | many are now useless without ai | | | fighter swarms, some carriers | | | have been nerfed to hard to | | | counter ai fighters that they | | | have lost more than 10,000 | | | health in the past month. This | | | is not good game design. | | | | | | Making a class so strong because | | | of ai fighter spam broke the | | | games balance, and forced devs | | | to nerf carriers hard. Do to | | | carriers being nerfed so badly, | | | many are outright garbage that | | | get outperformed by nearly every | | | other capital unless players buy | | | ai slots to make them somewhat | | | useable. No players want to | | | pilot fighters anymore when the | | | fighters themselves are getting | | | nerfed and made irrelevant | | | individually, because nobody | | | wants to pilot warpless ships | | | with worse damage than a | | | destroyer when they could just | | | spawn a battleship or | | | battlecruiser instead. | | | | | | Literally just code something | | | that reduces the damage of ai | | | fighters by 50% or something, | | | because right now this is just | | | messing up balance and causing | | | bad game design | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | to all of the people that get | qwertykiller475 | | combat ships and kill | | | defenceless miners, burn in hell | | | for eternity, i wish you nothing | | | but hatred and hell in your | | | miserable life, may it always be | | | in pain and nothing go your way, | | | die. You gys ruin ma ship and | | | loot it for the crappy silicate | | | it HAS?? legit, man go to hell | | | and Burn. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | This community is so unfunny. | OOOO_01O | | Nowdays people would just put a | | | nerd emoji under a chat bubble | | | and reply to someone with the | | | image implying that they are a | | | nerd, galaxy sucks, arcade sucks | | | even more and p2w games | | | shouldn't exist. I can't | | | believe you worship this game | | | instead of the impeccable garlic | | | bread, if you don't worship | | | garlic bread then you have the | | | IQ of nothing.

I'm ignoring all | | | DM's and anything you send to | | | me will be filed for evidence. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Hi, I am a player of your Roblox | SeaswimmerTheFsh | | game, Galaxy, and it has come to | | | my attention that the Borealis | | | has not been added back onto the | | | build menu. After waiting for a | | | large amount of time, I have run | | | out of patience. A few months | | | back, I lost my Borealis (and | | | this was during the Borealis | | | advanced period), hence making | | | me lose my Borealis forever. | | | Also, recently before the | | | change, I purchased this | | | carrier, but then it went | | | advanced. Now, here's a deal. I | | | PURCHASED this ship with ROBUX | | | in Galaxy Arcade, so a refund is | | | the correct course of action, as | | | the staff should have common | | | sense. A refund action would be | | | either returning my Borealis, or | | | giving me another ship of my | | | choosing. | | | | | | If I cannot be refunded, this is | | | unacceptable, as I spent ROBUX | | | on it, which costs real money. | | | No refund would force me to quit | | | your game and report you to | | | Roblox for scamming. I will wait | | | for a response. I'm tired of | | | waiting. It's been months. | | | | | | Sincerely, theneumanncraft | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | M class is love m class is | (???) | | supreme. The m class is a big | | | yellow boxy monsterous miner | | | that can be seen from eons away | | | as it eats away at dozen of | | | astroids per hour. The m class | | | while very large has a fair | | | speed for its size and great | | | turning speed. However be aware | | | while the ship is gargantuan in | | | size its hull is very thin | | | overall. This leaves it | | | potentially vulnerable to | | | threats such as pirates but | | | thats never stopped any of its | | | captains from getting the job | | | done. The m class has also been | | | known to be used as form of | | | protest for angry captains who | | | believe the economy is unfair | | | and deserves a change as well | | | such as better protection from | | | price gougers. This has led to | | | its infamous name known as the | | | dock blocking device. The m | | | class comes equiped with two m | | | class mining lasers as well as | | | heating and ac, but there have | | | been rumors of other variants of | | | the vessel being being outfitted | | | with more advanced lasers. The | | | control room is very small and | | | sports no living spaces as the | | | ship was not meant for prolonged | | | periods away from starbases and | | | has one huge monitor reading | | | status online. The rest of the | | | space on the ship is used to | | | capture astroids and process | | | them. safety protocols dicatate | | | no personal is allowed in the | | | ore hanger during the miners | | | operation due to the risk of | | | being crushed to death in the | | | astroid processing bay. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | I, as a seasoned Galaxy player, | iluvdetos | | am able to verify and affirm | | | that this report is true. To | | | expand, the specific report is | | | about the "Build Ship" menu | | | unintentionally omitting | | | manually fired guns from the | | | provided details of each ship. | | | Furthermore, ships containing | | | special abilities --- modules, | | | those are --- do not have | | | information on their abilities | | | included with the rest of the | | | information provided on the | | | "Build Ship" menu. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
