The Kneall Fleet Ship was a Alien ship that was introduced around the time of [Halloween 2018]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2018), The same time that the [Kneall Prototype]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Prototype) came out. The Kneall Fleet ship's function was to be the backbone of a fleet of aliens and basically be the captain of all the other ships, Meaning that where ever it went the rest followed.

## Description

The Kneall Fleet Ship shared the same model as the [Kneall Scout]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Scout) only being a little faster. It had no turrets, spinals or any type of weapon.

if you attacked this ship, it would work like any other boss by calling any other one of its kind to come to your position, This makes it really hard to kill it as it has all of the other kneall ships attacking you. ![Picture of the Kneall Fleet Ship (Sorry for low
