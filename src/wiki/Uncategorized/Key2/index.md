The **_Key2_** is a small, weak [**Admin**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) ship modeled after the [Kneall Scout]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Scout).

## Description

The **Key2** is an Admin Ship. On its own, it is definitely the worst Admin Ship out there, but it is needed for two admin-only quests that are used to spawn the **[Kneall Prototype]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Prototype)** and the **[Pleb's Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pleb's-Kodiak)**.

## Interior

The **Key2** has no interior.

## Advantages

- High damage resistance. (90%)

## Disadvantages

- Has no weapons.
- Terrible speed for an admin ship.
- Terrible turnspeed for an admin ship.
- Low health for an admin ship.

## Trivia

- In order to use this ship for the admin-only quests, you must spawn a **Y.Part()** and find a hidden teleporter located on the ship. You will then be teleported to a baseplate with 6 screens. Currently there are only 3 quests there - Admin Quest 1 spawns two **UNE Sovereign-X**s (currently broken), Admin Quest 2 spawns a **Kneall Prototype**, and Admin Quest 3 spawns a **Pleb's Kodiak**. The only way to complete the quests is by exchanging a **Key2** along with another one of the **Keys**.
- One of the worst admin ships out there, and it would be completely useless if it weren't for the admin quests.
- Shares its model with **[Key]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Key)**, **[Key1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Key1)**, and **[Key3]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Key3)**.
