# Trivia

- Apogee was the only ship available for 2 days until the full part 1 of the event released.
- The Excursion Staging Points were removed for some time during the event before being added back.
- The Stronghold was removed before and added during the event.
- The event itself was accidently released by a dev around 2 days earlier than it should've, this allowed players to see where all the quest locations were, and see the excursion staging point that allowed players to enter the rift, a protest also happened during those 2 days to tell the devs to release the event, which caused a lot of users to be banned and blacklisted due to some bad behavior in the protests.
