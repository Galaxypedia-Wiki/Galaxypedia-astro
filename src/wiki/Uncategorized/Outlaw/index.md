The [Outlaw]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Outlaw) was a boss used for Fourth of July event 2023 and [Fourth of July Event 2024]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-Event-2024).

In 2023, it was only spawn able via admin commands, But in 2024 it automatically spawned every hour

The Outlaw's loot pool can range between dropping 100-1000 smuggled oil, which is a huge amount compared to other event bosses

## Description

The [Outlaw]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Outlaw) is a super-capital ship with over 1 million health, It has a large turret range with a high top speed and acceleration.

## Strategy

- Grouping up is always required if you planning to fight this boss, as its large Dps can shred any ship in a matter of seconds.
- If there's a base near it, you can try and lure it to a base so it takes a large amount of damage so its easier to fight
- Try to get as much Dps on it as much as possible as it has a large loot pool and credit payout.

## Trivia

- Used to be spawned via an admin, This caused protests and complaints due to the lack of admin spawns that actually happened. Fortunately in 2024 when the boss came back, it was automatically spawned instead of being manually spawn able.
- Used to be a dread, But was then changed to be a super-capital
- Has the description as [The Patriot]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Patriot), Wherever if this is a mistake or not, its still interesting.
