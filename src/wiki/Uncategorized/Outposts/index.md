## Description

An **_Outpost_** is a generic [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) that has been built from a [Transport Vessel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Transport-Vessel) and can be placed anywhere in the map within a 100k range from another starbase, however they cannot be within a radius of 23k from another starbase. This is part of the Outpost update.

Outposts are normally created to get closer to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) or to the opposition. They are also known to spammed in [Economy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Economy) servers due to the high resource collection ![The spamming of outposts in an eco
server.](OutpostSpam.png "The spamming of outposts in an eco server.")

## Appearance

The **_Outpost_** looks exactly like a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).

## Creating an outpost

An outpost can be built by a leader of a [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) in exchange of the current selected starbase's resources. Building an outpost costs 25k silicate, 5k carbon, 4k iridium and 1k uranium. When selected a [Transport Vessel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Transport-Vessel) will fly to the selected spot (very slowly due to the Transport Vessel's lack of a warp drive) and once arrived will start spinning in place for around 20 seconds before spawning a new starbase.

An outpost cannot be named and will instead will take the name of Outpost-(random letter followed by a 2-digit integer)
