## Canada Day

Galaxy continues celebrating Canada Day, ever since it started the previous year of 2021. With the continuation of Canada Day, it has sought back the return of the [Maple Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Maple-Orca), launching the event on 12:25 AM UTC, July 1st, 2022. Alongside this, the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) was temporarily colored to the color palette of the Canadian flag, that of which is white and red. [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse), [Aura]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aura), [Catalyst]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Catalyst), [MRLS Launcher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MRLS-Launcher), [Tennhausen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tennhausen), and [Witch]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Witch) also received a red and white color scheme.

## Independence Day

At July 3rd, 9:50 PM UTC, 5 years in a row, Galaxy is continuing the celebration of America's Independence, and with that has brought back various freedom-brining machines, and also added new ones as well. Notoriously the new [stealth]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}stealth-ships) [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) [SR-71]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}SR-71). Ships that were re-added are a miner and a freighter, and a new one to the party being classed at frigate. The Mega Based replaced the Canadian palette with the American red, white, and blue colors. [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon), [Crucible]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Crucible), [Defiance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Defiance), [Devastation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastation), [Dire Wolf]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dire-Wolf), [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco), [Ibis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ibis), [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey), [Phantom]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Phantom), [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold), [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper), and the [Warden]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warden) all received the American color scheme. The [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base) remodel and a new related resource called "[Material Scrap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Material-Scrap)" were also added.

## Trivia

- The SR-71 is by far the most expensive ship in the event, coming at a hefty cost of 20 Stealth Plates, and 600,000 credits.
- This is also probably the first and only event to introduce a stealth ship, let alone a stealth dreadnought.
