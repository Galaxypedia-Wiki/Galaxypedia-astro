## Main Info

The April fools event 2024 saw a massive ship change where every model is either a [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) or a [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), This was also swapped with the models themselves! A limited button on the setting tab was added so you could change whenever you wanted the models to be swapped or not.

This event only lasted one day from the 1st of April - 2nd of April. ![April fools button to select if you wanted the models or

## Trivia

- Event only lasted one day, which caused a lot of servers to lag because of which the models were changed
- A video with ships sieging a base with the swapped models can be seen here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wlGWRQgOZw&t=15s>
- Scared a lot of new players thinking that they were getting attacked by a proto when it was only a model change
- Hitboxes of ships were not changed, this caused frustration with getting out of the ships themselves since the models were a different size to the actual ship itself
