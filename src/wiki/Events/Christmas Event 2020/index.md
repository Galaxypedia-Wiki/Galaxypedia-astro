Galaxy's 2020 Christmas Event is a holiday-themed event that follows in the footsteps of past Christmas events. This event had three main parts: the first saw some minor changes and the re-introduction of snowflakes; the second came with the introduction of new ships; the third added another new ship and some changes to [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous).

The event added Christmas-themed ships, red alien icons, and changes to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Mega-Base) and some Starbases.
