# Stage 1

The first part of the Christmas 2019 event started on December 2, 2019, and ended on December 20th. The following ships were added as part of the event: [Permafrost]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permafrost), [Icicle]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Icicle), [Snowfall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowfall), [Hailstorm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hailstorm), and its fighter, the [Frostfire]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frostfire).

The Christmas 2019 event is also the first ever to be separated into two distinct parts. When part one ends and part two starts, the previously available event ships will be removed from the shop and new ones will be added. The duration of the first part is currently unknown, but it is speculated that it will last for the first half of the month.

This event also saw the reintroduction of [Snowflakes,]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowflake) which have also been used in past Christmas events.

# Stage 2

The second part of the Christmas 2019 event started on December 20 and ended January 4th. This stage added the [Double Fractal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Double-Fractal), [Coldfront]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coldfront), [Antares]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Antares), and, later on, the [Santaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Santaliz).

For Christmas Day, December 25, this event's "free" gift ship was the [Snowball]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowball).

This stage of the event also featured the New Year's-themed [2020 Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}2020-Ship).

- The [2020 Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}2020-Ship) went offsale on the same day the event ended.
