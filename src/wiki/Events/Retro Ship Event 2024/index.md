# Description

The **Retro Ship Event 2024** started on May 5th^th^, 2024 and ended on June 10^th^, 2024. The event was the biggest Retro Event that has been made by far. The event revolved around the more recent "Excursion" mechanic, which was used in the Halloween Event 2023, which involves the user heading to an excursion point, a neutral base placed randomly on the map and heading into the excursion zone with up to 4 players, destroying bases and collecting items from enemy wrecks. Many previous Retro Event ships returned during this event such as the [Retro Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Prototype-X-1), the [Retro Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Prototype-X-2) and the [Retro Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Nyx), along with many new ships such as the [Retro Vanguard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Vanguard), the [Retro Nemesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Nemesis) and many more.
