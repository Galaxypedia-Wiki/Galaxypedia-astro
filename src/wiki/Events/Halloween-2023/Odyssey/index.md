The **_Odyssey_** is a limited [battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) which was added in the [Halloween Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2023).

## Description

The Odyssey is an medium-sized [battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) with a total health pool of 20k and a decent speed & Maneuverability. The ship is capable of long-ranging/kiting which gives it an advantage on sieging scenarios. The ship is also [Broadside]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) meaning it has an limited firing arc on all turrets. This ship contains 8 guns: 3 Advance Coilguns, 3 Quantum Lance-S, and 2 Laser Defense-S, but it lacks spinal weaponry. The ship has a low damage output for a limited [battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Appearance

![Thrusters of Odyssey while not on the module
mode.](Unfired-Module_Odyssey.png "Thrusters of Odyssey while not on the module mode.") The ship has an symmetrical approach to design like most ships: the back of the ship has multiple small and an large thruster, which lights up when the Afterburner [Module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) is activated. The ship details include 2 "fuel tanks" connected to the thrusters and possibly related to its ability. ![Thrusters of Odyssey while on

## Advantages

- Has long range turrets to outrange most ships.
- High health pool for its own class.
- Triples its speed when activating the [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules). (75 -> 225)
- High top speed for its class.

## Disadvantages

- [Broadside]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology), meaning that the turrets will have difficulty aiming at certain ship positions.
- Big hitbox/model.
- Easily hittable when out of [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules).
- Recharge of [Module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) to max capacity is long.
- Low damage output for a limited [battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Limited ship, making it a big/priority target among enemies.
- Needs materials from the rift, meaning you need to do the event to get this ship.

## Strategy

- Because of its long-range capability, kiting is an possibility on this ship, meaning you can outrange most ships on the battlefield.
- Together with its [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules), you can avoid shots much more with the bonus speed, which is a big advantage to avoiding alpha shots. (note: please time the [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) so you can maximize the usage and effectivity of the [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules))!
- Use the module, large profile, and high speed to speed tank the enemy if needed.

## Version History

possibly released within Version .77a31-32 along with Theseus because the event broke after being "released" by one of the developers. (accidental release).

## Trivia

- This ship is also the **first 3 ships** (Apogee, **Odyssey** & Theseus) under super capital ship status to have **_[modules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules)_**, giving it an _advantage_ over other ships of its class.
- In the rift, the Odyssey's module and range were useful to outrange the Abbadons/Azraels shots and kill them with ease and little threat.
- Named after the Greek hero-king and the play by Homer of of him, Odyssey.
