# Overview

The **2019 Halloween Event** started on Wednesday, October 15, and was presumed to run until November 15. This update fell under the larger version .66b and added several new ships and Halloween-themed decorations to the game.

Unlike past events, this year's featured multiple ships that were completely unique, rather than being reskins of existing models (with the exception of Plagued Warship, which is essentially a reskinned [Katana]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Katana) model). These included the [<span style="color:#ff7500">Astaroth</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astaroth), [<span style="color:#ff7500">Demon</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Demon), [<span style="color:#ff7500">Hallow</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hallow), [<span style="color:#ff7500">Plagued Warship</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Warship), [<span style="color:#ff7500">Aberrant</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aberrant), [<span style="color:#ff7500">Abaddon</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abaddon), [<span style="color:#ff7500">Azreal</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal), [<span style="color:#ff7500">Lucifer</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer), and the previously hidden event quest ship [<span style="color:#ff7500">Erebus</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Erebus).

Swarmers and Punishers, as well as their lasers, were recolored to deep orange. Their loot was increased, especially in that Swarmers drop 75 Uranium, and Punishers drop 500--750.

The [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Mega-Base) received one of the most ambitious Halloween reskins yet, and Starbases received an impressive cosmetic interior buff. This included pumpkins, bats, streamers, text on the interior displays of the starbase, and even a graveyard in the fighter hangar.

It is also the first Halloween event to not have a boss, and the first not to use special Pumpkin items for ship construction.
