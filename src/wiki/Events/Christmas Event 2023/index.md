## Description

The [Christmas Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2023) started on the _26th of December_ and ended on the _17th of January 2024_. It **did not** introduce any new ships, however it came with many past event limited ships being available to build on the [Build Menu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu).

## Ships

**Re-released ships:**

- [Festive Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp)
- [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp)
- [Festive Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wyrm)
- [Hailstorm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hailstorm)
- [Antares]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Antares)
- [Snowfall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowfall)
- [Icicle]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Icicle)
- [Permafrost]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permafrost)
- [Viking]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viking)

## Bosses

The event introduced a new boss, The [Festive Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Kodiak). The Festive Kodiak had the same model as the normal [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak), only being white and having Christmas decorations scattered around its model, such as a Christmas hat.

The [Festive Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Kodiak) was a hard-to-kill boss and required a large fleet to take down, the Festive Kodiak had a special ability where it and any of its fleet's ships that it killed would be reincarnated into a pirate ship to fight with the fleet, this caused a lot of expensive ships to be lost under the time of several days.

## Other Changes

Other changes that the event included was:

- A limited reskin for several [Build Menu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) ships
- A new module for the [Snowfall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowfall)
- Changes to the [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold)
