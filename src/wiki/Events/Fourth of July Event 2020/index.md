# Trivia

- **Update Log Description**: _Celebrate the United States' independence with three returning ships from previous events! A shrine to the Eagle has been created in the Mega Base, maybe it knows something... This event will last for three days_
- Unlike the previous Fourth of July events, this event saw the introduction of a completely unique ship, the [Liberator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Liberator) and Freedom Galaxy rather than only introducing reskins of existing ships.
- The total cost to obtain the ships at the time of the event was 3,710,347 credits
- On the 9th the admins were told to enter and shut down the servers; they shut down a UCU server and others but were unable to get them all. On the 15th the last server, controlled by Blackhawks, was shut down by Roblox for their weekly update.
