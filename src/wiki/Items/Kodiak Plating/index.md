title: Kodiak Plating
---

The **Kodiak Plating** is a special [Item]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}items) used as a material for making the [Kraken Armor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken-Armor), which is then used to build the [Kraken]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken), which is an expensive but highly effective Dreadnought.

Every [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) wreck drops 2 of these, but each player can only have 1 in their cargo hold at any given time. This means that the first 2 people to loot Kodiak with over 350 cargo hold will get one.

**Kodiak Platings** sell for about 2.2k credits at the mega base. But due to the [Kraken's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken) extreme cost, and only requiring 2 **Kodiak Plating** per Kraken, it is common to see thousands of **Kodiak Platings** in the Mega Base.
