## Overview

The [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) Core is an item obtained from the [Kneall Eradicator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Eradicator) during waves 7 & 8 in the [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold) bossfight. It can be used to build the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator) and the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2). To obtain one, you must first pass the 15% damage threshold on a Kneall Eradicator, and you will receive an item from it's loot pool. The Kneall Core then has a 35%(?) chance of dropping.

It's original purpose was to build the [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator) and, with the exception of the [Devastator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastator) event, was only obtainable once from it's quest [The Last Signal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Last-Signal). When the Kneall Stronghold was introduced, the Kneall Core cost was removed from the Obliterator and the Kneall Core was made infinitely obtainable.
