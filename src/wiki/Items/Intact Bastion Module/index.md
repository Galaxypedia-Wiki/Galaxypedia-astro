## Overview

The Intact Bastion Module can be used to build the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1). Repairing the [Fractured Bastion Module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fractured-Bastion-Module) is quite expensive, at a whopping 7,170,000 total cost. This is done through a quest at the [Derelict Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Derelict-Station). Repairing the part removes it's ability to be sold.
