## Overview

The Charged Kneall Munitions are a part required to build the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2). To charge the munitions, first go to [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad) and enter the underground maze through the hole in the small corridor in the main area. Once you're in the maze, simply go to the right and then take the first right turn, and you will find an NPC named Felktor. He will charge your [Depleted Kneall Munitions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Depleted-Kneall-Munitions) for the low low price of 7,500,000 credits. The now charged munitions can be used to build the Prototype X-2.
