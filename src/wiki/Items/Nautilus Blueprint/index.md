## Description

An item you get given for completing the [Mythical Blueprint]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strange-Character) Quest. It costs 250k [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) from the [Strange Character]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strange-Character) at [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base). It is required to build the expensive battleship [Nautilus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nautilus).

## Trivia

- Used to only allow players to obtain it once, it was then changed for players to repeat the quest as many times as they like, making the nautilus less valuable and more common than before.
- ![The update-log message stating that the quest is now infinitely
repeatable](Updatelog-nautilus.png "The update-log message stating that the quest is now infinitely repeatable")Was once called "Blueprint for nautilus" when it first came out, it was then changed in an unknown version a couple of days after it had been added.
