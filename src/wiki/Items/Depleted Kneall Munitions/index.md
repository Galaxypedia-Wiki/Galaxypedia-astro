## Overview

The Depleted Kneall Munitions are a rare part obtained from the [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold), with a mere 4% chance of dropping. This item can be sold for 750,000 credits, or used to build either . To build the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), the part must first be [charged]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Charged-Kneall-Munitions) from a quest at [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad). To create the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), it must be converted at the D Terminals in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) to the [Fractured Bastion Module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fractured-Bastion-Module), which must later be converted to an [Intact Bastion Module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Intact-Bastion-Module) at the [Derelict Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Derelict-Station). Both the Depleted Kneall Munitions and Fractured Bastion Module can be sold at the quest in the Mega Base for the 750,000 credit amount, but converting them into their usuable counterparts removes this ability.
