{{< notices/underConstruction >}}

The **_Space Pumpkin_** is an item used by the player to make [Event Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) during the Halloween Events in Galaxy.

## Halloween Event 2018

The **Space Pumpkin** is a special item used to create limited ships during the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018). They can be looted from [Alien Harvest Servitors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Harvest-Servitor) (2 each) or [Harvest Kings]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) (30 each). The versions used in this event take up 50 cubic meters in a Cargo Hold and can be sold for 1200 credits (and bought for around 1300).

## Halloween Event 2017

Previously, **Space Pumpkins** were the materials needed to be collected for the [Halloween Quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Quest). (Five were needed to complete the quest).Â You got them by defeating and looting the [Grim Reaper.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim-Reaper) However, it may have taken many [Grim Reaper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim-Reaper) kills and fights to get enough of these, as people often quickly stole them and ran off. These also could have been bought via the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). They could be bought for 1,650 credits and sold for 1,350 credits.

## Halloween Event 2020

This year **Space Pumpkins** are replaced with Gamma Pumpkins.
