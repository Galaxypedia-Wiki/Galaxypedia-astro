The **Scout Component** is an [Event Item]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}event-items) used as a trade in for the quest _Dire times and Dead ships_, which gave 8k Credits found within the [U.N.E Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E-Starbase) during the [Ultimate Retro Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ultimate-Retro-Event-2022).

The **Scout Component** was also featured as an [Event Item]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}event-items) for the [Halloween Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2022) which gave players 40k if they sold it but due to a mistake Scout Components were far more expensive than intended. As of now it gives 8,000 Credits.

### Trivia

This item can give 8,000 Credits instead of 40,000 due to a recent update as a refund when it is inside your ship when a round ends, or when a server gets shut down.
