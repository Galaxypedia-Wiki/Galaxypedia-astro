Void pumpkins were used in the 2020 Halloween Event to build the ships [Naga]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Naga) and [Incarnate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Incarnate). It was only dropped by the [Rift Guardian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rift-Guardian) and [Rift Custodian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rift-Custodian) which gave 1 and 3 respectively. Seeing as they were rarely dropped, they were highly sought after and "vulturing" was at an all-time high during the event. Selling one of these pumpkins would give you a lot of credits and is very profitable to sell.
