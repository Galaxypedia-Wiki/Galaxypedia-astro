## Description

The **Debt Token** is a special [Item]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}items) used mainly for Punishments from Admins due to various reasons.

This Item has a negative buy and sell value, meaning you gain credits when buying it, **BUT** also lose more credits when selling it, hence its name. Additionally, if you have any of the item in your [warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse), **you are unable to spawn any combat ships** (i.e. Any ship which is not a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) or a [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)).

## Trivia

- This item is the only item in the game that takes absolutely no space in a player's warehouse.
- Before this item prevented the spawning of combat ships while in possession of it, it was frequently used to get a "loan" of credits to make expensive purchases whenever there was a large amount of this item in stock.

- Item size changed from 7.5mÂ³ to having no size at all, along with now preventing the spawning of combat ships while in possession of said item in version .76b2, February 16, 2022.
