The **Red Diamond** is a special item that currently has no use.

It can only be obtained through Galaxy Creator [Rcouret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rcouret)'s ship wrecks with a random chance to acquire when looting.

## Trivia

- A planned way to acquire [AI Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI-Fighters) without Robux was to trade 1 Red Diamond to a computer in the Sales Floor of [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). It is unknown on whether this will be released or is cancelled.
