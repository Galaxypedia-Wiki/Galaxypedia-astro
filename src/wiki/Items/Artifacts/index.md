## Description

**Artifacts** are 3 rare items used as materials for powerful ships and for some special quests. They are extremely lightweight and only take 0.5 Cargo Hold each.

**Artifacts** can found at any point in space, but are quite rare and are only visible on the HUD 1000 studs or below, making this strategy of finding artifacts slow and inconsistent. Killing the pirate ship [X-0]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}X-0) is the only other way to acquire these materials, but it is the only way of acquiring large amounts of artifacts, so it is competitive and difficult to loot the [X-0]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}X-0) before other players do.
