## Overview

As the name may imply, the Conqueror Reactor Core is used to build the [Conqueror]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Conqueror), which is the [UNE]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}UNE) equivalent of the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator). It is obtained from converting the [Annihilator Fighter Bay]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator-Fighter-Bay) at the quest in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) D Terminals, and can be sold there for 375,000 credits.
