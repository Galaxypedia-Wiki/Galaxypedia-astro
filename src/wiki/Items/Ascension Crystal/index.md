## Description

**Ascension Crystals** are one of the 3 [Artifacts]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Artifacts) in the game.

**Ascension Crystals** appear as red, glowing/sparkling crystals.

Like the other [Artifacts]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Artifacts) (being [Data Archives]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Data-Archive) and [Antimatter Shards]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Antimatter-Shard)), Ascension Crystals can be obtained by finding them in space, but they are quite rare and only show on the HUD within 1,000 studs. The method most players use to acquire these is by looting X-0, where you can reliably get multiple if you get the first loot.

## Trivia

- Previously, the Ascension Crystal was used in a quest given by the [Monogram]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Monogram) in [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous)'s asteroid belt. The Data Archive was used in a quest found on [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad)'s moon. They were also used to make special ships called "Artifact Ships," now known as "[Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships)" After an exploit for creating these ships came out, they were subsequently disabled and eventually re-added, but this time without the cost of **Artifacts**. Instead, their prices rose dramatically. However, recently, they were readded to the Mega Base's Terminal D's sales floor on a 3 ships per rotation basis. More information [here]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Ship-Computers).
