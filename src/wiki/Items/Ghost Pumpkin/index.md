{{< notices/underConstruction >}}

The **_Ghost Pumpkin_** is a special item that was dropped by the [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) during the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018), which was used to build the "true ship" given to you in a quest from the [Grim Reaper (NPC)]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}<Grim-Reaper-(NPC)> "wikilink"). They can be looted from Alien [Harvest Kings]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) (25 [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) and 1 **Ghost Pumpkin** each).

For quite a while, the [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) were the only pumpkins dropped by the [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) and were used to build **[7]** limited event ships during the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018). However, after the [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) reached Stage III in its final evolution on October 30th, it began to drop **Ghost Pumpkins**, 5 of which are highly sought out by the [Grim Reaper (NPC)]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}<Grim-Reaper-(NPC)> "wikilink") in his pre-quest dialogue.
