## 2020

**Snowflakes** are once again physical objects just as they were back in 2018 and earlier. These **Snowflakes** can be found in [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) and [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous) in certain spawning locations. In order for any **Snowflakes** to spawn in a private server, at least 4 people need to be present. Additionally, a minimum of 6 players are required for snowflakes to spawn at Aqueous.

Snowflakes will respawn at set locations on intervals of 10 to 15 minutes.

Mega Base Spawning Locations:

- Main Lobby inside wall of Gazebo
- Far end of the Game Contributors hallway
- Right side behind the curtain of the auditorium on the second floor of terminal B
- Corner of 2nd floor terminal A
- Advanced ship Requisition (Terminal D Floor 2) Behind Super Cap Terminals

Aqueous Spawning Locations:

- In the center of the level one base, or outside the pillar of an upgraded base
- Near the edge of the laser fence on an upgraded base, or near one of the doorways? on a level one base
- Near another doorway on a level one base, or out in the snow on an upgraded base
- In a cave near terminals D and E

## 2019

The source of **Snowflakes** for the previous Christmas Event, the [Christmas Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2019), are the [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), which have been redesigned for the event. [Alien Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) drop 1 Snowflake and [Alien Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) drop 20.

## 2018 and Earlier

**Snowflakes** were previously physical objects found in-game. They were used in the 2017[Ice Monster]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Ice-Monster) quest to create the [Blizzard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blizzard) and the 2018 Christmas Event to create ships. These neon-blue objects were found at every base except forÂ [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion) & [Military HQ]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Military-HQ). They only spawned when a minimum of 6 people were in a server during the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018) (Public Server or Private Server).

When these were available during the past events, players could obtain one by walking over to where the **Snowflake** was and touching it to pick it up. The Snowflakes would then automatically be moved to the player's warehouse.

The **Snowflakes** used to spawn in these areas of the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), and [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous).
