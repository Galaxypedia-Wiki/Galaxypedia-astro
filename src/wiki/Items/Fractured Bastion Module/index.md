## Overview

The Fractured Bastion Module is a part required to build the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1). To do this, it must first be repaired at a quest in the [Derelict Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Derelict-Station), to create an [Intact Bastion Module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Intact-Bastion-Module). The cost to repair the part is a hefty 6,000,000 credits and one [Weapons Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Weapons-Part), which costs 32,500 uranium, which in turn costs 1,170,000, for a total cost of 7,170,000. The now intact part can be used to build the Prototype X-1. Repairing the part removes the ability to sell it.
