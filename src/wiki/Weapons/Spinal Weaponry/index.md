{{< notices/outdatedInfo >}}

**Spinal Weaponry, **informally **'Spinals',** are manual weapons that are found on most combat ships. **Spinals** can be classified into 3 types: *Phasers*, _Cannons_, *Torpedoes*.

**Spinal Weaponry** is aimed manually by the pilot and requires the pilot to fire all shots at a time. Since they do not fire automatically like [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) the pilot's ship needs to be pointed towards its target in order to land a hit. There is though a small amount of movement for your spinals depending on where your cursor is.

**Spinals** are activated with the keys **F** and **G**. The key **F** is the **Primary Spinal**while **G** is the **Secondary Spinal**.

**Spinals** deal high damage per shot, but they have low projectile velocity.

A moving target isn't always easy to hit with large **Spinals**, which is why [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) prefer small **Spinals**, as the projectile speed of small **Spinal Weaponry** is greater, therefore increasing the reliability against moving targets. However, projectiles in small **Spinal Weaponry **has considerably less range.

Most ships are equipped with *Phasers* and *Cannons* as **Spinals**, with varying to degrees of firepower. Some ships rely entirely on **Spinal Weaponry** for their firepower, while others are equipped with them as a secondary weapon.

## Phasers

**_Phasers_** deal high damage to [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) but low damage to [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) and move quickly. They appear as a flat, semi-transparent, red-orange beam and make a sharp "pew" sound when fired. Upon impact, phasers emit red plasma chunks (with trails) similar to the visual effects seen when damage is dealt to a ship's hull. The sound is repeated for each phaser fired.

## Cannons

**_Cannons_** deal high damage to [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) but low damage to [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and move slowly. They appear as white cubes with a grey, pebble-like pattern on all sides. They also give off a tan-white trail when fired, and make a unique noise when fired. Some ships have **Cannons** that make a minigun-like noise when fired, most notably the [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold).

## Torpedoes

**_Torpedoes_** are special weapons only found on a select few ships. Some of these ships have unique **Torpedo** designs. The only NPC ships with **Torpedoes** are the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak), [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher), and [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator)

Their long-range, high damage per hit, and low projectile speed makes them powerful against static and slow targets. Torpedoes do not ignore damage resistance.

## Trivia

- If a Torpedo hits a player's **starbase**, the whole faction will be notified with the message "A Torpedo has hit your base."
- You can see if your torpedo has reloaded by looking in the barrel from where it fires from.
- Since Torpedoes are ranged, travel slowly, and have high damage, some people prefer it for [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging).
- The [Tengu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tengu) used to bear 2 Small Torpedoes before they were replaced with 4 Medium Cannons.
- The three ships with a Huge Torpedo are the [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon), [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion), and [Antares]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Antares).
- The [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) used to contain 8 Medium Torpedoes, allowing it to have the highest amount of damage per volley. (4000) before it was replaced with 2 Huge Torpedoes. This change has since been reverted.
- The [Hasatan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hasatan) used to have 1 Huge Torpedo before it was downsized to 1 Large Torpedo.
- Some ships have a unique torpedo explosion sound effect, such as the Kraken using a Kraken railgun sound effect and the Hyperion using the sound effect also used for Heavy PDLs, although much more drawn out and louder.
