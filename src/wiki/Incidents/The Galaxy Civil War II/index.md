{{< notices/communityIncident >}}

The **Galaxy Civil War II**, also known as the **Enigma Cache Incident**, is known as the worst bug/mistake to have existed in Galaxy and the second biggest incident in Galaxy. Second only to the [Confinium Pay-to-win Incident]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Confinium-Pay-to-win-Incident).

This is essentially a repeat of the [first Galaxy Civil War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Galaxy-Civil-War) (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU READ IT FIRST). [Sugondese]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Smallketchup82) (smallketchup82) did not start this, it was started a while before Sugondese announced its official start.

[Sugondese]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Smallketchup82) was the first to call the event(s) the Galaxy Civil War II, meaning it had officially started after Sugondese declared its start in the Galaxy Discord Server on May 18th, 2021 despite the original date of the incident being April 28th 2021.

## Prologue

<div class="cardcontainer" style="text-align: justify;">

[Patanautic]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}PataNautic), the newly appointed Shipmaster, decides to add a special artifact to the loot table of [Alien Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) and [Decimators]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator). This artifact was named "Dimensional Alloy" and sold for 500 (?) Credits at Mega Base. One would drop in every Kneall Punisher wreck, and five for each Decimator, accounting for its incredible spawn rate and ease in defeating and farming them.![Slimyorca greenlighting the
abuse](TGCW2_Ticket-1072.jpeg "Slimyorca greenlighting the abuse")They were promptly "replaced" with Plasma Batteries, a similar artifact. However, these old Dimensional Alloys were warehouse transferable. The player could then travel to Frion on a public server and interact with the unfinished "Enigma Cache" Quest. **For** **each** **Dimensional Alloy,** **$500,000 credits were paid to the player.**

Sometime before the incident began, a ticket in the Official Galaxy Discord was opened by a mannered player, inquiring about if it was okay to use the obtained Dimensional Alloys to complete the quest. A Galaxy Admin (SlimyOrca) replied with what was essentially permission to do the quest, as seen in the image below:

Afterwards, more players presumably completed the quest under the assumption that it wasn't punishable to do so; as a Galaxy Admin gave permission in response to the inquiry. The incident went public on April 28th, 2021. However, the fire truly started about a day or two before, within the staff chats.

Purpeldazee (whom will be referred to as purple for simplicity) pinged the Galaxy Admins on a matter about an exploiter who wanted their items. She asked if everyone agreed. Two admins, Logan_Bowers (Loggue) and SuperChip15 (ChipsOmen) disagreed with the matter... They were threatened with **demotion**. This ignited the staff team's discontent towards purple's habits and ways, especially Loggue.

On April 28th, 2021, four admins - asd1232468, ChipsOmen, Loggue, and CaptainLosticJR were demoted for the abuse of the formerly-mentioned Enigma Cache quest. An old shipmaster/dev had left the quest lying there after he was demoted. The current Dev, PataNautic (Pata) unknowingly added the material needed to complete the repeatable quest. The rewards yielded 500K credits, and the materials were far too easy to obtain with a single dreadnought or carrier.

Players and Galaxy Staff alike used the Enigma Cache quest to gain massive amounts of credits, and therefore ships. The administrators who abused the quest were demoted and blacklisted from ever obtaining a staff position again, players were logged on sight in public servers, and many account warehouses were either manually flooded with [Debt Coins,]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Artifacts) or simply wiped altogether.

While you might expect this to be what inspired the {PS} label for private server quest logging, that is not correct. The label was added because of NPC fleet spawns for staff being added and the developers wanting to make sure staff members did not spawn and kill NPC fleets in private servers, earning large amounts of money.

## Beginning

<div class="cardcontainer" style="text-align: justify;">

After the demotion of the admins, a riot started on the Galaxy Discord server. People were furious about the demotion of the admins. Purple responded by right-click-banning everyone who insulted, questioned, or even said anything regarding purple's role as Head of Staff. At the same time as the bans, she put a 6-hour slowmode on every channel, but the riot still continued. Purple decided to lock down every public channel and only keep the general channel accessible to the players as damage control mounted. After 5 hours, the general slowmode was reduced to 2 hours, gesturing to the opening up of the discord server.

**Simultaneously, discord rules were changed to allow staff the power to permanently ban anyone for anything.**

Afterwards, screenshots appeared of purple talking to Confinium about destroying Galaxy, which made people even more furious.

## Climax

<div class="cardcontainer" style="text-align: justify;">

Riots and slow-modes became a daily occurrence! A former moderator, Vsauce, revolted against purple by deleting everything he could in the main Galaxy discord, causing a lot of people to flock to the Galaxy Wiki discord, asking what had just happened. Eventually, they did restore the main Galaxy discord and a semblance of peace emerged.

After a week, things started to settle down. However, it was then that purple decided to ban Sugondese and demote [teentitansgohomee](https://www.roblox.com/users/342108306/profile) from admin to modeler, again upsetting the community, as Teen was one of the most well-liked admins. When people questioned purple about her demotion of Teen, she simply replied he was "Too busy IRL", almost the exact same thing she said when she also removed Sean for no reason. She initiated another lockdown, activating a 6-hour slowmode on most channels, and she also went on another ban spree, right-clicking people left and right.

After that, another brief period of peace occurred. This was interrupted by a now-former admin, Nekowok (xUnex), who took a similar approach to Vsauce by banning most of the staff team except [Rocket](https://www.roblox.com/users/380593774/profile) and Purple. Rocket came in and asked what happened and Neko simply answered that they 'resigned.' Neko then asked Rocket to have his roles removed and at some point later was presumably banned by either Rocket or Purple. The staff that were banned were brought back and had their roles restored, including Teen's role as an Administrator.

Another notable event was the "Sugon Revolution," where many players **changed their Roblox display names and Galaxy Discord profile picture to match that of Sugondese**, **including Rcouret.**

---

A few days later, a **highly controversial rule was added saying that insults were now ban-worthy** and a small commotion broke out, but nothing bad really happened. Later, SmokeyJoe and Lightflase were promoted to admin, causing another disturbance to happen, as SmokeyJoe was not a well loved or respected moderator. Sugondese responded by taking the Galaxy Bot down as an act of spite and left the server, although he later came back.

---

After yet another period of peace and silence, [DylanTheVillan101]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}DylanTheVillain101), a moderator at the time, was **demoted and banned** for quoting Jeffenator and editing the image to portray Jeff as a p\*do. This led to **another riot in the community and a sweeping 30-minute slowmode lasting well over SIX hours.**

During this riot, people got very angry about the fact that Dylan was demoted and banned, people started to insult the staff and most of the Galaxy Community agreed that they lost the "last good moderator". This was said because Dylan was not nearly as disliked as SmokeyJoe38 and Jeffenator, as the both of them often gave very unreasonable moderations and were generally strict.

While Dylan was banned and the riot was ongoing, Sugondese, a well known member in the Galaxy Community, started to defend Dylan. Sugon got very angry and explained why the staff team is bad, etc. Sugon eventually left the Galaxy Discord Server, vowing to never come back. Shortly after Sugondese left the server, he was (possibly) banned then got unbanned. This caused him to experience something called a "Phantom Ban" and had to use a VPN to rejoin the Discord Server. Where he then made a message replying to a question SmokeyJoe made. In his message, he ended it off **saying that "The Galaxy Owner and Galaxy Staff are all clowns. This Discord Server is a literal circus"** to which he was **banned** for Staff Harassment. When he questioned SmokeyJoe about it, Smokey said that he was told to ban Sugondese for 30 days because someone told him to. He later confirmed that purple told him to ban Sugon for 30 days.

The warning system at the time did not have a 30 day ban punishment listed in it - Sugons punishment **was actually an act of admin abuse** by purple.

## End

<div class="cardcontainer" style="text-align: justify;">

On October 11, Purple randomly banned 13 people - including 3 newly chosen Trial Moderators. An exploiter was among the banned individuals. Soon after, Rcouret arrived. After people told him that Purple was randomly banning people, **Rcouret finally decided to revoke her perms to ban and demoted her from Head of Staff.**
