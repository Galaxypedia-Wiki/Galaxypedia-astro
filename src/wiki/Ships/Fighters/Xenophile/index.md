{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Xenophile_** is a very fast but fragile **[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)**, being one of the 3 fighters to spawn in [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion), the others being the [Striker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker) and [Nighthawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nighthawk).

## Description

The **Xenophile** was one of the first [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to be added to the game, along with the [Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury). It carries two small [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and has a top speed of 300. It has the second lowest health pool of any [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) in the game. It spawns in [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion)'s Lucifer Station and (?)

## Appearance

Like all fighter class ships, the **Xenophile** has little in the way of an interior.

## Advantages

- Highly maneuverable.
- High speed.
- Fast [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals) reload speed.
- Can assist in wearing down [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields).

## Disadvantages

- Low health.
- Only 1 spawns in [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion).
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aren't very powerful.

## Strategy

- Work with other fighters to take down ships by staying in the enemy's blind spots.
- Avoid ships with high-accuracy or high rate-of-fire turrets (Gatlings), as they can deal significant damage to fighters and will destroy them if given the chance.
- Use your insane speed to distract weapon fire while others rake down the target.

## Version History

- Remodeled in version ??

## Trivia

- Second fighter to ever be added.
- Not many players know of its existence, due to the fact that only a single one spawns on Frion.
- Used to spawn in [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) until they started to only spawn [Starbase Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury).
- Four of these fighters would spawn on the **L科科約科科約希吉科約希吉約希希吉科約希吉約希吉**, otherwise known as the **[Abomination]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abomination)**, before being replaced by two "Xeenophiles," which were Xenophiles stripped of all weaponry.
- Since the creation of the Galaxy Info Bot back in gamma, only a single player has ever lost a ship to a Xenophile. Loudboom46's [Stealth Recon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stealth-Recon) was consensually sacrificed to a small batch of Xenophiles coming from DylanTheVillain101's **L科科約科科約希吉科約希吉約希希吉科約希吉約希吉**.
