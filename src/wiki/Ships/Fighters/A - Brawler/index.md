{{< shipInfobox >}}

_This article describes the fighter, not an actual NPC vessel, nor the Player owned battleship. For the NPC boss with the same model, see [Kneall Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Brawler), for the player owned battleship, see [Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Brawler)_.

The **_A - Brawler_** is an [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens)-themed **[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)** that spawns in the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator).

## Description

The **_A - Brawler_** is a small, powerful, [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)-like fighter that is spawned on the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator) which is based off of the [Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Brawler).

## Appearance

The A-Brawler has an identical appearance to the battleship [Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Brawler).

The **<u>Interior</u>** is a simple black box with a black seat on the front, there is no exit teleporter once you get inside, making you trapped inside unless you reset.

## Advantages

- Very powerful for a fighter, has stats akin to a battleship and more DPS than most battleships
- Very high health for a Fighter-class ship.
- Good amount of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) for a fighter, with a decent 7.
- Can provide as much support as most [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Disadvantages

- As with all Kneall based ships, the turrets are rather inaccurate.
- Easy to hit and destroy due to the sluggish mobility, and complete lack of damage resistance.
- Like with all other fighters, no warp drive.

## Strategy

- Use this monster of a fighter like a sacrificial battleship.
- Get a skilled player inside the Brawler, as AI Fighters shoot spinals inconsistently and turn their backs sometimes, losing half of its firepower.
- Avoid going head-to-head against a dreadnought or higher class ship if you aren't planning to sacrifice yourself yet.

## Version History

- Added in version .75a10
- Health nerfed to 300/300 until the duration of the ongoing [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event)
- Name changed A - Bioicle -> A - Brawler .75a37

## Trivia

- Once you enter the fighter, you cannot get out unless you reset because there's no exit teleporter inside the ship.
- Almost identical to the [Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Brawler).
- Lower health, fighter class instead of battleship class and slightly lower spinal DPS than [Kneall Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Brawler). Otherwise identical.
- One of the strongest fighters in the game, tied with the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis), which is also a Battleship-like fighter and also one of the only 2 [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)-like fighters in the game.
