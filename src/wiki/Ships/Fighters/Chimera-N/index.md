## Description

The Chimera-N is a fighter for the carrier [Conqueror]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Conqueror) that uses the model of the [Chimera-S]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera-S)

## Appearance

The interior is a replica of the [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera) interior.

## Advantages

- Relatively good speed, higher than other ships its size.
- Good health, making it possible to tank nukes.
- No spinal weaponry, making it easier to pilot.
- Has four times the amount of total health as its destroyer counterpart, the [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera).

## Disadvantages

- No [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive), meaning it must be released and deployed by the carrier pilot close to the intended target.
- Slower and less maneuverable than most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Even with its high health, it can still be shredded by the average Capital ship.
- A lot of its health is shield, making is susceptible to ships like [Jupiter]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jupiter) and [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus).

## Strategy

- Support your fleet or [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) with these Battlecruiser-Fighter hybrids. You can easily destroy Capital ships when used alongside the [Conqueror]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Conqueror).
- Stay with the [Conqueror]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Conqueror) and help defend it or help engage other targets. When all [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) are used alongside the carrier, they form a very formidable mini-fleet. Â 
- Make sure to work together with your carrier, as it can provide support against much bigger and stronger ships that may pose a threat to you.

## Version History

- Added on 2024/04/12, but not logged in an actual version. The most recent version after its implementation is .77d22.

## Trivia

- The model is an exact copy of the [Chimera-S]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera-S), which is just a reskinned [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera).
