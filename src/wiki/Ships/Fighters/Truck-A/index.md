**Truck-A** is a fighter disguised as a normal truck on Pyramus.

# Description

The **Truck-A** is designed to closely resemble a [M35 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M35_series_2%C2%BD-ton_6%C3%976_cargo_truck) truck used by the United States Army. Unlike a real truck it is a flyable fighter disguised as a truck which can be used by the player.

# Advantages

- Due to said disguise it can be used to surprise any fleet and possibly deter them. Most times players do not know about it being an actual fighter on Pyramus.

# Disadvantages

- No warp drive.
- All of its DPS relies on spinals, meaning the pilot needs to know how to utilize spinals to unlock this ship's combat capabilities.

# Version History

Added on version .75
