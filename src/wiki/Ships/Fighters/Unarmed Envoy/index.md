{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Unarmed Envoy_** was a small, limited remake of the [Dropship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dropship) [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) that uses a reskinned old model, and is a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)-[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) hybrid, eventually removed once it stopped spawning on the Lucifer Station.

## Description

The **Unarmed Envoy** was a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) with no weapons whatsoever. It is meant purely for distracting bases or to scout what ships the enemy faction has. Its model is based on the old model of the [Dropship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dropship), but with a few changes, mostly recoloring. This ship could have been found on [Lucifer Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion), but it and the [Dragonfly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragonfly) were replaced by the [Striker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker) and [Xenophile]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xenophile).

## Appearance

The back of The **Unarmed Envoy** has two large benches containing six seats in total. The cockpit has a small pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Has high health for a ship of its class.
- Quite fast, despite its slow acceleration.

## Disadvantages

- Has slow acceleration compared to other fighters.
- Weakest fighter in the game, this is because it has no weapons, as expected for a ship of its name.

## Strategy

- Use the Fighter's manageable speed to scout out enemy bases or distract enemy ships.

## Version History

- Received a buff in .64d? that increased this Fighter's [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) by 300 each, and another buff that gave it one [Light Flak Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), which made the name confusing.
- Started spawning on Lucifer Station in .65b.
- 1 [Light Flak Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) removed in version .69a2, which once again made the ship true to its name.
- Stopped spawning on Lucifer Station in version .73b, along with the [Dragonfly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragonfly), this marked this ship's removal from the game.

## Trivia

- The **Unarmed Envoy **once had 1 [Light Flak Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), which was ironic considering it's name is the ***Unarmed *Envoy.**
- The spawner used to be broken.
