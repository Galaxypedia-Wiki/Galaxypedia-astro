{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Nighthawk_** is a fast but weak [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Description

The **Nighthawk** is a fighter similar to the [Xenophile]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xenophile) but with a focus on shield health rather than hull health. However, it is one of the slowest [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) in the game. It only spawns on the [Lucifer Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion).

## Appearance

Like all fighter class ships, the **Nighthawk** has little in the way of an interior.

## Advantages

- Small ship, making it quite difficult to destroy.
- Can assist in wearing down enemy shields.
- Deadly in swarms.

## Disadvantages

- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) do little damage to hull.
- Low total health of 150, even [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) can deal with this because Mining Lasers can attack other ships now and are shield based.
- Only effective against shields.
- Slow speed for a fighter.

## Strategy

- Work with other Fighters to take down larger ships.
- Use with other Fighters to distract a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase)'s lasers in a siege.
- Use its speed to scout a Starbase. You can jump out of the ship above the Starbase and stand inside and give information about ships and Starbase condition.
- Avoid ships with high maneuverability or lots of small turrets. Ships like the [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest), [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) and most [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) will easily take fighters down, especially at close range.

## Version History

- Buffed in .75a3.
- Remodeled in .64f.
- Started spawning on [Frion's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion) Lucifer Station in an unknown version.
- [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) increased from 50 to 125, [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) reduced from 150 to 25, Top Speed reduced to 170 and received a remodel in version .69a2.

## Trivia

- Because of how rare it is to see these ships in [Galaxy](https://web.roblox.com/games/200330616/Galaxy#), many players are surprised to know it still exists. It is only known to spawn inside the Hevnetier.
- Used to spawn in Starbases until they started to only spawn [Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury).
- Has 4 reskins in the form of 3 separate Fighters and 1 Admin Ship; [Firehawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Firehawk), [Bonehawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bonehawk), [IceFyre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}IceFyre), and the [Spectating Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spectating-Ship).

<!-- -->

- It looks very similar to a raven from starcraft.
