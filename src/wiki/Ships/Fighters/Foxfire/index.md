{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Foxfire _**is a small and fast **[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)** found on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz).

## Description

The **Foxfire** is a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) added to the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz). It is a small sleek ship that, alongside it's high top speed, has a relatively easy time dodging enemy fire.

## Appearance

The Foxfire is a fighter with a relatively large size. It is a flat ship that has a similar shape to the [Spectre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spectre), featuring 3 of its spinal barrels on the front, and the text **"FOXFIRE"** on its side.

The Interior of the **Foxfire** is nothing more than a small cockpit containing the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Can inflict high damage to [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- High Top Speed and small size makes it difficult to hit.

## Disadvantages

- Extremely low health and non-existent Damage Resistance of 0%.
- Little to no [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.

## Strategy

- Focus on [Shielded]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) ships to deal as much damage as possible.
- This Fighter is best used in a swarm. Attack the enemy with high speed and with its high shield damage, a swarm will bring enemy ships to Hull quickly.
- Utilize drifting and hit-and-run tactic to survive as long as possible while dealing the maximum amount of damage.
- Avoid attacking any ship that can take down fighters easily, such as the Ampharos or the Mjolheimr.

## Version History

- Removed from the Nimitz in an unknown version.
- Nimitz remodel reverted, making this ship playable again in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- One of the three [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to replace the [Interceptors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor) that were previously spawned on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz).
