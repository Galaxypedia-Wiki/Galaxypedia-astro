{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Falcon_** was a **[Fighter-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)** ship unique to the [Vanguard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard).

## Description

The **Falcon** was a unique [Fighter-Class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) ship resembling its namesake that can spawn only in [Carrier-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) ships. It is a relatively normal [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) in speed and size, and is currently the 4th fastest behind [Xenophile]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xenophile), [Nighthawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nighthawk), and [Dragonfly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragonfly). The **Falcon** only has three tiny [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), which is made up for by a very quick reload speed. Furthermore, the **Falcon**'s low firepower is compensated by _very_ high health for a [fighter-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) ship, even more than some [Frigate-class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:-frigate) ships.

## Appearance

Like all [Fighter-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), the **Falcon** has little in the way of an interior.

## Advantages

- Fast.
- Maneuverable.
- One of the tankiest fighters in game, beaten out by the [Harbinger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger) and [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis) as well as the [Sakalas]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala) old [Sanguine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sanguine) Fighters, and tied with the [Interceptor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor).
- The three tiny phasers reload very fast, allowing it to fire rapidly.
- Higher health than some [Destroyers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) and [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Disadvantages

- Little firepower, with only three tiny Phasers.
- Susceptible to light [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Only two of them spawned in their signature carrier, the [Vanguard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard).
- Because it only spawned in the [Vanguard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard), it requires at least one [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) person due to the Vanguard being a VIP ship.

## Strategy

- Like any [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), hide in a ship's blind spots.
- Try to work together with multiple [fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to make up for the low firepower and to distract [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets).
- Be especially careful fighting ships like an [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos), as it and others have many high-accuracy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) that can easily destroy even this high-health [fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Rotate the ship a lot to lower your chance of getting hit.
- Slow down a bit when fighting smaller enemies.
- Get inside a starbase by going into a docking port and start to eat up the base's health. (caution: possible ban)

## Version History

- Tiny Phaser spinal count increased from 1 to 3 in version .72f1.
- Removed from the [Vanguard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard) and replaced with Y.Falcons in version .74b14.

## Trivia

- The **Falcon** was designed specifically for theÂ [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass)-only [Carrier-Class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) ship, the [Vanguard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard).
- Currently so part-shifted its almost impossible to get in the pilot seat.
- The **Falcon** is actually small enough to fit in a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase)'s docking ports.
- Not fly-able in-game anymore since they were removed from the vanguard/
