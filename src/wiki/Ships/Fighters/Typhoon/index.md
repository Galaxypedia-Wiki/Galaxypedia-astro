The **Typhoon** is a fast fighter-class ship that is carried aboard the **[Stormbringer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stormbringer)**.

## Description

The **Typhoon** is a dedicated shield breaker that also has some cannons available on the side, much like its parent ship. It is also designed to be the polar opposite of the [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz), a fighter carried aboard the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis), a carrier which is (not coincidentally) the opposite of the **Stormbringer**.

## Appearance

The **Typhoon**'s appearance is similarly styled to that of its parent ship, sporting a mostly greyscale colour scheme with neon orange accents. As with many smaller ships in the game, it bears a resemblance to a real-life plane, specifically a fighter jet. There is not much in the way of an interior. A simplistic seat inside a pass-through cockpit windshield on the stern of the ship.

## Advantages

- Capable of dealing both hull and shield damage, due to it having both cannons and phasers, however it boasts far more phasers than cannons.
- Low spinal cooldown.
- Very high firepower.
- 6 of these fighters are carried on each **Stormbringer,** providing capacity for [fighter swarms]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fighter-Swarming).

## Disadvantages

- No turrets.
- Purely [spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry)-based weaponry requires good aim to deal any damage at all.
- Below average health which allows them to be swept aside quicker.

## Trivia

- The **Typhoon** replaced the **[Wrath]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wrath)** upon its addition in the 3rd remodel of the **Stormbringer**, the **Wrath** belonging to the 2nd.
- A storm becomes a Typhoon if it becomes powerful enough, which explains the name of the fighter.

## Version History

- Added in version (?), replacing the **Wrath** as the **Stormbringer's** unique fighter following the latter's 3rd remodel.
- Health increased (250/250 -> 300/300) .75a12
