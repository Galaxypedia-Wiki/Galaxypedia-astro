{{< shipInfobox >}}

_This article describes the fighter, not an actual NPC vessel. For the NPC with the same model, see [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bruiser)._

The **_A - Bruiser_** is an Alien-themed Fighter that spawns in the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator).

## Description

The A - Bruiser is a small, powerful fighter that is spawned in the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator) based off the [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bruiser).

## Appearance

The A-Bruiser has an identical appearance to the Alien NPC ship [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bruiser), but made moderately smaller.

The **<u>Interior</u>** is nonexistent and the pilot seat is instead, at the back of the fighter. ![Pilot

## Advantages

- A powerful fighter overall.
- Agile and small, making it hard to hit.
- High health for a fighter.
- Has more DPS than it's NPC counterpart.
- Long range and accurate turrets for a fighter.
- <s>Cute</s>.

## Disadvantages

- Very low turret DPS.
- Majority its DPS comes from its spinal weaponry.
- Below average top speed for a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Very bad turret placement, you cannot fire both turrets unless you're above your opponent, which would in turn not allow you to fire spinals.

## Strategy

- Utilize drifting and hit-and-run tactic to survive as long as possible while dealing the maximum amount of damage.
- Fly together with your other fighters.
- Can fight both small and capital ships efficiently.
- Focus on swarming and destroying [AA]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}aa) ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron) first, as they will shred you if left alone.

## Version History

- Added in version .75a10
- Health nerfed to 200/100 until the duration of the ongoing [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event) in version .75a10

## Trivia

- Better than [Kneall Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Bruiser) in every way except shield hp.
- One of the only ships that is better than its NPC counterpart.
- Has the turret with the longest (and possibly funniest) name in the entire game.
