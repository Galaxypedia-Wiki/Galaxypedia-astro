{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Sanguine_** was the original [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) found in the [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala).

## Description

The **Sanguine** is a large and powerful [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) with a well-decorated interior, previously spawned only in the [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala). Though it is technically a fighter by its reliance on Carriers for deployment and warp capabilities, it has the health and firepower of a Cruiser or Battlecruiser class warship.

## Appearance

???

## Advantages

- Very high firepower for a Fighter.
- High health for a Fighter.
- Good assortment of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- No blind spots.
- Can take on Battlecruisers and below if both are deployed.

## Disadvantages

- The slowest Fighter, having 40 less top speed than the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis) and [Harbinger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger).
- Poor maneuverability, especially for a Fighter.
- Large for a Fighter and easy to hit (It is the size of a cruiser).

<!-- -->

- No [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive).

## Strategy

- Can be used to support a fleet, but can't hold its own in a fight.
- Good against [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) or other Fighters smaller than it, but is unable to combat larger ships on its own.
- Use in swarms and with other ships to create a powerful force.

## Version History

- Received a nerf to its shield health in version ???
- Received a "retro" remodel inspired by the Gargoyle from Star Conflict in version .64c.
- The [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala)'s fighters were replaced with [Firehawks]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Firehawk) in .65a, making this ship unavailable to normal players.

## Trivia

- In order to exit the Sakala's original hangar, this fighter needed to drop downwards.
- ![An old sanguine in the hangar of the original Sakala

- The old model had a ladder on the side of the ship that is necessary to enter it while docked in the hangar. It shared much in common with the destroyer-class [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera).
- Large for its class.
