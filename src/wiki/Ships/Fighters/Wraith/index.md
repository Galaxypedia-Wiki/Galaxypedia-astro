## Description

The **Wraith**is a long range, torpedo equipped reskin of the [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz).

## Appearance

The **Wraith** is a flat and medium-sized [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters). Unlike the [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz). this variant is translucent and has an orange and brown color palette. Its torpedoes are also transparent and have unique models.

While travelling, it emits an orange trail behind it and it's torpedoes.

The <u>**Interior**</u> is extremely small and empty, just like most other [Fighters.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)

## Advantages

- Very mobile [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) with high evasion and maneuverability.
- Long range small torpedoes at 9k Studs.
- Balanced [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- High firepower for a Fighter with 150 [DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang).
- Can drift at high speeds _(90% Drift),_ like all other [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Disadvantages

- Can be easily destroyed by [AA]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) Ships.

## Strategies

- Work with other [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to quickly destroy other [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) and drain health quickly.
- The spinals have a higher range than most ships and bases. Utilize this to your advantage.
- A small siege fleet or support can be formed with your other Wraiths as each fighter has 2 Small Torpedoes, which can outrange [Starbases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases).
- Focus on swarming and destroying [AA]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron) first, as they will shred you if left alone.
- Use the ship's high maneuverability to get into the blind spots of larger ships and deal heavy spinal damage.

## Version History

- Received a buff to its (G) [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in an unknown version update, which replaced its 4 Tiny Cannons with 1 Small Torpedo.
- Received a remodel in version .69e.
- Torpedo count increased from 1 to 2 in an unknown version.
- Small Phaser count increased from 2 to 3 in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- The **Wraith** was added alongside its carrier during [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018).
- Like the [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz), the entirety of the Wraith has no hitbox, except for it's teleporter.
- One of 3 Fighters, alongside the [Firehawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Firehawk) and [Bonehawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bonehawk), to have a trail.
- First and the only 3 [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to have Torpedo weaponry, the other being the [Frostfire]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frostfire) and the [Inflictor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Inflictor)
