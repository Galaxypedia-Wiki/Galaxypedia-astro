{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_ShieldSide_** is a "Fighter" found on each side of the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator).

## Description

The **ShieldSide's** primary purpose as implied in the name; is to act as a static, physical shield on the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator). It's fairly large in size, but is only really effective against incoming turret firepower from the sides.

## Appearance

The ShieldSide looks like its, name, a Shield, with 2 equipped on each side of the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator). The ShieldSide is extremely long, almost spanning length of the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator). It is curved, with a blue-ish color and has hexagonal textures on themselves.

## Advantages

- Highest health out of all [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)-class ships.
- Incredibly effective at tanking kinetic weaponry.
- Large size allows it to function well as a shield for the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator).
- Acts as an expendable health for the already extremely high health of the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator).

## Disadvantages

- Incredibly weak to anti-shield weaponry, not to mention ships with very high alpha damage are able to wipe this shield out in a single volley.
- Due to being a "Fighter"-class ship, the shields have 0% Damage resistance.
- Only is effective at tanking against [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower; [Spinal Weaponry]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) passes right through the shields as if they're not there.
- Can block [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) line of sight of the **Subjugator** at some firing angles.
- Doesn't cover the entirety of the **Subjugator's** sides, as it falls short of covering the far ends (the front and rear of the ship on each side respectively).

## Strategy

- Position your **Subjugator** well in order to make full use of the ShieldSides, as they act as expendable health.
- Always face the enemy at your sides in order to use these well.
- It is better to use this to tank against Capital Ships rather than swarms, because swarms rely on spinals to do damage, which ShieldSide cannot protect [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator) from.

## Version History

- Health changed from unknown amount^(please add former shield health amount)^ to 9,500/1 Shield/Hull HP in unknown version^(please add version when possible)^.
- 9,500 changed to 8,500 Shields in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- Due to it being a Fighter, it can re-spawn, or rather "Regenerate" after a period of time.
- The only "Fighter" that is present on a [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).
- The first ship of its type to be introduced into the game, and also unique in that it is the only Fighter unable to be piloted.
- Despite having spinals, the ShieldSide cannot be piloted, making them useless.
- There used to be a ShieldFront counterpart to this ship on the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator), but it was removed from that ship. It was similar to this ship, except that it had a smaller profile.
- The [UNE Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}UNE-Subjugator) lacks both of these in each sides of the ship, unlike its playable counterpart.
