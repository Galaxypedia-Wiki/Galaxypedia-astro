{{< shipInfobox >}}

_Not to be confused with the [**Cruiser-class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) [Instigator-A]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Instigator-A)._

The **_Instigator _**is a [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) that spawns on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz).

## Description

The **Instigator **is a one of the three [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) variants that spawns on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz), the other being the [Foxfire]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Foxfire) and [Interceptor F]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor-F).

## Appearance

The Instigator features two large barrels at the midsection of the ship, which is where it's 4 [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fire from. The rear end of the ship also raises up a bit, which is where its [Light Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) sits. The Instigator has an almost identical appearance to the [Instigator-A]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Instigator-A), bar the color.

The Interior of the **Instigator **contains nothing more than the pilot's seat, which is situated in front of three glowing panels.
