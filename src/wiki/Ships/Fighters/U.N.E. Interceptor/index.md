## Description

The U.N.E. Interceptor is a fighter on the [Conqueror]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Conqueror) carrier. It following the trend of the [Interceptor F]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor-F), it looks nothing like the original [Interceptor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor), instead more closely like a [Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury). The Conqueror is equipped with eight of these sleek, fast fighters.

## Appearance

The U.N.E. Interceptor has a similar appearance to the [Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury), with a body that resembles a fighter jet, two large wings, two small guns, and two large engines. Also like the Fury, it has no interior, with a small cockpit that has a seat in it. Its wings have large gaps in the middle when looked at from the front.

## Advantages

- Small, fast, and hard to hit.
- Decent DPS, which becomes very large when all 8 are in use.

## Disadvantages

- Very low health, making it susceptible to nukes and AA ships.
- No [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) weaponry, so it can only attack when facing directly towards it's target.

## Strategy

- Drift around targets, bombarding them with your [Spinal Weaponry]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Avoid large nukes and the [Lucifer's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer) [Module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules).
- Use as many of these as possible; their strength lies in numbers.
- Avoid accurate ships as they will shred you at close range.
- Attack small, fast ships that you are able to hit with spinals, clearing them up so that the carrier can attack larger targets.

## Version History

- Added on 2024/04/12, but not logged in an actual version. The most recent version after its implementation is .77d22.

## Trivia

- Despite having similar names, it, the [Interceptor F]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor-F), and the [Interceptor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor) look nothing alike.
- The [Conqueror]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Conqueror) has four fighter bays for this ship; Two ships are in each bay, and each side of the Conqueror has two bays.
- Very closely resembles a modern remodel of the [Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury).
