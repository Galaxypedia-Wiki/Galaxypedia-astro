{{< shipInfobox >}}

_Not to be confused with the [Nixesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion), a fighter from the [Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx)._

The **_Nyxesion_** is a [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) unique to the [Retro Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Nyx).

## Description

The **Nyxesion** uses the old model of the [Nixesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion), however it has modified stats compared to the mentioned ship.

## Appearance

The Nyxesion is a small fighter that bears a resemblance to the [Dragonfly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragonfly), with 4 wings on the back.

Like all fighter class ships, the Nyxesion has little in the way of an **Interior**.

## Advantages

- Spinal DPS of 102 can lead to a monstrous DPS of 1160 when all fighters are used.
- Like with most fighters, small size.
- Balanced [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) firepower.
- Easy to control since it moves slow enough for the pilot to react.
- A couple of **Nyxesions** can destroy a Level 1, 2 and even a level 3 or 4 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) if undefended.
- Effective when used to swarm large [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), and [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- Just 2-3 can deal more damage than most [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)

## Disadvantages

- Somewhat slow for a fighter, still faster than the [Nixesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) though.
- Can be shot down easily by Light Turrets.
- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Strategy

- Group together with your other Nyxesions, as all 12 in a swarm can bring as much destruction as a [Prototype]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes) ship.
- Focus on swarming and destroying AA ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron) first, as they will shred you if left alone.
- Use the ship's high maneuverability to get into the blind spots of larger ships and deal heavy spinal damage.

## Version History

- Added to the game on version .73a3 along with [the carrier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Nyx) that contains these ships.
- Name changed from Retro Nixesion to **Nyxesion** in version .75a1.
- Cannon and Phaser intervals changed from 0.15 --> 0.20 in an unknown version

## Trivia

- Has the most fighter count in a single carrier in the game at **12**, tied with [Bonehawks]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bonehawk).
- Has an even older model older than it's current model, which the [Spirit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spirit) also uses.
