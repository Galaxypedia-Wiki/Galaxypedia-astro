{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Elanis _**is a large and extremely powerful shield-breaking [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) made by the [Slarfie]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slarfie) that is found exclusively on the [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier).

## Description

The **Elanis **is a powerful, [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)-like fighter that is spawned on the [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier). It is a uniquely-designed fighter which integrates into the front of the carrier it spawns on.

## Appearance

The Elanis is a large, flat, triangular fighter with a cyber aesthetic identical to its Carrier, the [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier). The ship uniquely makes out the front of the Hevnetier.

The interior of the **Elanis **is entered through a teleporter at the back, and it is nothing more than a small box with a neon screen containing the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Very high health for a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)-class ship.
- Fires all spinals at the same time.
- Has a **Monstrous [Shield DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang)** of 457, higher than [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) shield breakers like [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) and [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus).
- Flat size might make it a challenge to hit with heavier weapons.
- Extreme agility and speed for a Battleship-size fighter.
- Good turret placement.
- Has 90% [Drift]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting), like all other [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Can provide as much support as most [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Insane amount of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) for a fighter, with a whopping 8.

## Disadvantages

- Very low [Hull DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) compared to Shield.
- Only one spawns on the [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier).
- Large, and has no damage resistance.
- No warp drive.

## Strategy

- Get a skilled player inside the Elanis, as AI Fighters shoot spinals inconsistently and turn their backs sometimes, losing half of its firepower.
- As this is a fighter feel free to do suicide runs.
- Turn your **Elanis** 90 Degrees from its axis then [Drift]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting), but with Z and C, this makes it much more harder for enemies to hit you.
- Focus on shield tanks like the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement) or [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis) first, as the Elanis focuses on shredding shields.
- If fighting or providing support against a fleet, avoid Hull tanks like the [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon) as the Elanis has extremely low Hull damage compared to Shield Damage.
- Use your turrets while recalled without the problem of needing to be recalled in order for the Hevnetier to warp.
- Can be used with the [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier) in conjunction to offset its low hull damage.

## Version History

- Introduced in version .69a2.
- Buffed in .75a3^(Please list what was changed about the ship)^.
- Buffed again in .75a10. 115 to 200 Speed, 0.3 to 0.5 Turn speed, 35 to 50 Acceleration. Gains 2 more Small Phasers and 5 Small Cannons replaced with 5 Small Phasers.

## Trivia

- The **Elanis** is unique in the sense that it is the only [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) that is part of its respective carrier's main structure. In this instance, the **Elanis** makes up the front of the [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier).
- One of the strongest fighters in the game, tied with the [A - Bionicle]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}A---Bionicle), which is also a Battleship-like fighter and also one of the only 2 [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)-like fighters in the game.
- A [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) variant called the [Mega Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Elanis) was released in the April Fools 2022 event. The ship was redboxed due to it being free and incredibly overpowered for it's class.
