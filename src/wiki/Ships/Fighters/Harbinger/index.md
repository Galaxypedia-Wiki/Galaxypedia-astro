{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Harbinger_** is a large **[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)** spawned by the [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus).

## Description 

The **Harbinger** is a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)/[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) hybrid that is carried by the [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus).

## Interior 

The interior is simple, with a teleporter pad that takes you into a room that has a carpet and a few screens as well as the pilot seat. The interior of the **Harbinger** is the same as the [Marauder's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Marauder).

## Advantages 

- Able to effectively engage in combat with both large and small ships due to its variety of weapons.
- Great firepower when [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are used to best ability.
- Massive health compared to most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Massive firepower for a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) and very effective if all [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) are launched together.

## Disadvantages 

- No [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive), meaning it must be released and deployed by the carrier pilot close to the intended target.
- Slower and less maneuverable than most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Low turn speed for a [Fighter.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)
- Only about half as durable as its [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) counterpart [Marauder]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Marauder), due to fighters having 0% [damage resistance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Damage-Resistance).

## Strategy 

- Support your fleet or [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) with these Battlecruiser-Fighter hybrids. You can easily destroy [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) when used along with the **[Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus)**. 
- Stay with the **[Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus)** and help defend it or help engage other targets. When all [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) are used alongside the carrier, they form a very formidable sub-fleet (squadron).  

## Version History 

- Added in version .66b along with the [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus).
- Max Speed increased from 115 to 140, Turn speed increased from 0.3 to 0.39, and Acceleration increased from 20 to 30 in version .72f1.

## Trivia 

- Has 500 more health than the [Marauder]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Marauder).    
- The fighter is unique to its carrier, the [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus).    
- The **Harbinger** is the only fighter to have a true interior and a teleporter.
