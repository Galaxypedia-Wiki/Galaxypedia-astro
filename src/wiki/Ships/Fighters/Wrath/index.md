{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **Wrath** was the predecessor to the **[Typhoon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Typhoon),** and was a small, agile fighter with a versatile weapons array. It was previously carried aboard, and was unique to, the **[Stormbringer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stormbringer)**

# Description

The **Wrath** had a design theme very similar to its former parent ship: a greyscale colour scheme and aggressively jagged shape.

# Advantages

- Its speed allowed it to distract and draw fire away from [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- High [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health compared to other [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) its size.
- Somewhat high [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) heath for its size.
- Spinals dealt balanced damage to [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)

# Disadvantages

- No [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive).
- relatively low damage output.
- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets): required aiming capability with spinals.

# Strategy

- Support your carrier by taking advantage of its speed on starbases and annoying any attacking ships without enough accuracy to hit you.
- As with any other small vessels, get in larger ships' blind spots and stay away from pest-control ships such as [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr) or [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos).
- Make the most of all of your spinal weaponry whenever possible, as small ships are easier to aim with and you're not going to get in much damage any other way.

# Version

- Added in version (?) as a custom fighter for the **[Stormbringer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stormbringer)** following the arrival of its 3rd model.
- Replaced in version (?) by the **[Typhoon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Typhoon),** a fighter designed for the **[Stormbringer's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stormbringer)** 4th model.
