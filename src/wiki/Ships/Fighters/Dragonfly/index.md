{{< notices/removed >}}

The**_Dragonfly_** was a weak but extremely fast **[Fighter]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:fighters)** that spawned in a player starbase, and was the fastest fighter in the game. It used to be in the Lucifer station, but then was changed to spawn in starbases, then changed again to not spawn at all and was replaced by the [Starbase Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury).

## Description

The **Dragonfly** was the first [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) added into the game and was originally a ship that was spawnable by players. It was the game's fastest [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), with the second smallest health pool, and one of the three [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to have a [Small Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) as a weapon, the others including the [Nixesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) and [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz). This fighter used to only spawn on [Lucifer Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion), before it and the [Unarmed Envoy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Unarmed-Envoy) were replaced by the [Xenophile]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xenophile) and [Striker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker).

It was then changed to only spawn in level 2+ starbases, with 2 dragonflies sharing a rather small fighter bay with 2 [Starbase Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury). This was then changed again with only the [Starbase Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury) spawning in level 2+ starbases.

## Appearance

Like all fighter class ships, the **Dragonfly** was little in the way of an interior.

## Advantages

- Very quick.
- Can weaken [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) so teammates can finish them off.
- Was the fastest fighter in the game.

## Disadvantages

- Low damage.
- Hard to aim at moving ships.
- Smaller spinal count than the Starbase Fury.

## Strategy

- As the fastest non-limited ship in the game, this ship is fantastic for distracting base fire. Even open fire from many ships will not be able to hit this from time to time.
- Work with other [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to harass large ships.
- This ship is weak against almost everything alone, so it is better as a distraction.

## Version History

- Remodeled in .61e4?
- Started spawning on [Frion's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion) Lucifer Station in an unknown version.
- Stopped spawning on the Lucifer Station in version .73b along with the Unarmed Envoy, and were replaced by the Striker and Xenophile.
- Started spawning in level 2+ faction-owned Starbases.
- Stopped spawning within starbases in an unknown version![Old

## Trivia

- Used to be a possible fighter spawn for a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) along with the [Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury) and the [Xenophile]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xenophile), and it got added with the Fury.
- Used to spawn into the [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier) before the fighter randomization feature was removed from the [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier). After the carrier's remodel, it lost the ability to spawn the fighter, leaving the [Blizzard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blizzard) as the only ship that could spawn it.
- Replaced by the [IceFyre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}IceFyre) in the Blizzard buff.
- Used to only found on Frion's orbital space station.
