{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Blitz_** is a powerful [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) found in the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis).

## Description

The **Blitz** is a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) that spawns exclusively on the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis).

## Appearance

The Blitz is a relative small and flat Fighter that has a spiky appearance, along with a large cannon on its side.

## Advantages

- DPS of and combined can lead to a monstrous DPS when all fighters are used.
- High turret DPS results in incredibly quick and consistent DPS against any target.
- High speed.
- Can cripple [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) as large as [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) with multiple [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) alike.
- Can drift at high speeds because of the 90% [Drift Percentage]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting) for Fighter-class ships.

## Disadvantages

- Low health.

## Strategy

- This [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) is best used in a swarm. Attack the enemy with high speed and with its high shield damage, a swarm will bring enemy ships to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) quickly.
- Use this ship in a fleet because its high firepower can tear down [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships).
- Utilize drifting and hit-and-run tactic to survive as long as possible while dealing the maximum amount of damage.
- Avoid attacking any ship that can take down fighters easily, such as the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or the [Mjolheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr).
- Either keep your distance from your target at all times or make use of their blind spots.

## Version History

- Shields reduced from 150 to 140, Hull reduced from 200 to 175, Top Speed reduced from 210 to 200, 3 [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) upsized to 2 [Huge Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry), 3 [Small Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) downsized to 3 [Tiny Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) and received a remodel in version .69e.
- 2 [Huge Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) downsized to 3 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in an unknown version.
- Interval for both spinals decreased (0.1 -> 0) Health increased (250/250 -> 300/300) Explosion radius increased (1 -> 40) .75a12
- Spinals nerfed and Blitz count increased from 6 to 12 in its Carrier the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) in version .75a37.

## Trivia

- Added in version .61h
- Added along with the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) as its [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Previously the only fighter to have [Huge Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Looks somewhat similar to an old model of [Lazarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lazarus).
- Due to the fact that the **Blitz's** model has almost no collision, it is possible for the player to fly into the interiors of [Starbases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) or even other [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), however doing this with the intention of destroying said Starbase or Carrier is a bannable offense.
