{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Wasp?_** is a "[**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)" that spawns in the [Waspinator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator).

## Description

The **Wasp?** is a fighter unique to the [Waspinator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator), an April Fool's carrier that looks like a massive Wasp. There is no visible difference between this ship and regular Wasps, though this ship has stronger stats than its Miner counterpart.

## Appearance

The **Wasp?** is very similar if not identical to the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp). Like the majority of fighters, there is little to no interior, as you just sit in a seat on top of the ship.

## Advantages

- High health for a fighter.
- Speedy and Agile.
- Small build makes it hard to hit with larger [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Has the highest range out of any turrets in the game, at 9000 Studs.

## Disadvantages

- Only spawns in the [Waspinator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator).
- Low DPS.

## Strategy

- Swarm enemies as the carrier, the [Waspinator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator), has 10 of these.
- Distract enemy turret fire as other warships attack your target.
- Mine away Starbases at a whopping 9,000 studs away.

## Version History

- Added in the [April Fool's Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2022).

## Trivia

- Has the longest turret range out of any playable ship in the game, at 9000 studs.
- Extremely similar if not identical to the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp).
- the ? in **Wasp?** is part of its name, so it may look weird in the middle of sentences.
- The [Waspinator's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator) Galaxypedia link forwarded users to a Rickroll video during April Fool's.
