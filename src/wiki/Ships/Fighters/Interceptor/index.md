{{< shipInfobox >}}

The**_Interceptor_**was the first **[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)** to have a [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) instead of spinal weaponry.

## Description

The **Interceptor** previously spawned on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz) and is one of few fighters that spawn with a[ Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) instead of spinal weaponry. The **Interceptor** can spawn with either a Medium Laser (S) or a Medium Flak Cannon (H). Currently it does not spawn in game normally, with the 13 **Interceptors** normally spawning on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz) bring replaced by 3 Instigators, 3 Interceptor H-s, and 7 Foxfires.

## Appearance

Like all fighter class ships, the **Interceptor** has little in the way of an interior.

## Advantages

- It has a [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), unlike most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Can quickly overwhelm ships in numbers.
- In large numbers, the amount of turrets of the combined forces can overwhelm other ships.
- It has decent health for a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters),
- Moderately accurate turrets allow the ship to combat moth large and small ships.

## Disadvantages

- [Medium Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) miss smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) more often.

## Strategy

- Make sure your team is in a bunch of these and aim at the same ship.
- Always go under a ship.
- Swarming with all [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) from [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz) creates huge damage comparable to a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) or some [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Good for warding off enemy scouts. Additionally, it can defend from [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) when no one else is available.

## Version History

- Small Flak Cannon replaced with Medium Flak Cannon / Light Laser replaced with Medium Laser in .61g.

## Trivia

- These two [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) originally spawned in the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz).
- Previously the only fighter to spawn in level 3 [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase). This was changed in a sub-version of update .61 that changed the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) design.
- Both S and H are the only Fighters to have a flag.
- American flags on the nose of the fighters pay homage to the US supercarrier from which the Interceptors' carrier, the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz), gets its name.
- No longer spawns in game after being replaced by 3 new fighter types on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz).
