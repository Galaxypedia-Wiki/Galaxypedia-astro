{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_F-18_** is a small, fast **[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)** found on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz) based from its real life counterpart; The [F/A-18 Hornet]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:McDonnell-Douglas-F/A-18-Hornet).

## Description

The **F-18** is a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) exclusive to the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz). It is a small sleek ship that, alongside it's high top speed, has a relatively easy time dodging enemy fire.

## Appearance

The F-18's appearance is that of a modern [Fighter aircraft]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:Fighter-aircraft) with design and shape similar to the [F-A/18 Hornet]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:McDonnell-Douglas-F/A-18-Hornet).

The **<u>Interior</u>** of the fighter is nothing more than a small cockpit containing the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Balanced Shield and Hull firepower.
- High Top Speed and small size makes it difficult to hit.
- Spawns in fairly high quantities on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz), up to 11.
- Has 90% [Drift]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting), like all other [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Disadvantages

- Has low firepower compared to other Fighters.
- Can easily be shot down by [AA]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) ships.
- Extremely high cost to have all fighters in use at once.

## Strategy

- Swarm the enemy with your 11 fighters on the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz). Even a [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) may retreat from your swarm.
- Focus on swarming and destroying [AA]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) Ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron) first, as they will shred you if left alone.
- Use the ship's high maneuverability to get into the blind spots of larger ships.

## Version History

- Added in an unknown Version.
- Replaced the [Foxfire]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Foxfire) due to the model being reverted in Version .75a5
- Removed from the game due to reversal of the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz) model in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- One of, if not, the only [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) class ship that has its appearance fit the ship category's namesake its in.
- Based from its real life counterpart; The [F/A-18 Hornet]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:McDonnell-Douglas-F/A-18-Hornet).
