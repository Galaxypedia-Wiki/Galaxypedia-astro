The **_Striker_** is a [**Fighter-class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) ship found in multiple [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Description

The **Striker** is a flat, sleek [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) found on a few [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) such as the [Rhino]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rhino), [Revelation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revelation) and [Rapture]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rapture). It also spawns on [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion)'s Lucifer Station.

## Interior

Like all fighter class ships, the Striker has little in the way of an interior.

## Advantages

- Medium Phasers give it strong anti-shield damage.
- Overall [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) DPS is rather high(?) for a Fighter.
- Flat profile and good agility makes it more difficult to get hit.

## Disadvantages

- Has lower [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health than [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health, making it weak to [Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Medium phasers somehow have a lower damage-per-second output than small phasers, making this fighter weaker than others such as the Nixesion or Raptor.

## Strategy

- Use the ship's high maneuverability to get into the blind spots of larger ships and deal heavy spinal damage.
- Focus on shield tank ships such as the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis), as the Medium Phasers are more powerful than the Small Cannons.
- Swarm enemy ships with your other fighters.
- Focus on swarming and destroying AA ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron) first, as they will shred you if left alone.

## Version History

- Shields buffed from 250 to 360 in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- Nothing notable.
