{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Hunter_** is a **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)-[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)** hybrid carried by the [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner).

## Description

The **Hunter** is a modified version of the [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova) spawned by the [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner) carrier with no warp drive and a color scheme similar to the Executioner's.

## Appearance

Similar to the [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova), it has no interior

## Advantages

- Has a very large health pool for a fighter.
- Deals massive damage with its spinal-based weapons.
- Combined with the [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner), the combined DPS is insane.

## Disadvantages

- Has no warp drive
- Only spawns in its signature carrier, the [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner).
- Doesn't have any [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Large size for a fighter makes it easier to hit.
- Is generally slower than other fighters.

## Strategy

- Deal as much damage as possible while your carrier warps out.
- Stay in battle for as long as possible, and nuke the fighter when your health gets low.

## Version History

- Buffed in an unknown version
- Turret loadout changed: 1 Medium Cannon, 2 Light Lasers -> 2 Light Cannons, 2 Light Lasers .75a12

## Trivia

- Carried by the [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner) carrier.
- Classified as a fighter because it only spawns in a carrier, yet has stats that mirror the [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova) Battlecruiser.
