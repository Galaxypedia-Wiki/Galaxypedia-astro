{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Swarmer Prototype_** is a [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) and was the first player-operable Alien-built ship.

## Description

The **Swarmer Prototype** is a modified version of the wrecked [Alien Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) on [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad). It is a [Fighter-Class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) Ship that has 1 [Light Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). Four of them spawn once [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad) is upgraded to level 3. Alongside the [Interceptor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor), [Sanguine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sanguine), [Valkyrie]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Valkyrie) and [Unarmed Envoy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Unarmed-Envoy), it is one of the five [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to have a [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). 

## Appearance

Like all fighter class ships, the **Swarmer Prototype** has little in the way of an interior.

## Advantages

- High health.
- One of the few Fighters with a [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Fast top speed.

## Disadvantages

- Slow acceleration and turn speed.
- Lowest DPS in the game since the damage of the [3D Printed Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}3D-Printed-Wasp) got buffed.

## Strategy

- _Swarm_ enemies and stay in their blind spots.
- Distract large ships and destroy small ships with this ship while defending Myriad.

## Version History

- Wings removed at some point due to model glitches.
- Received a [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) buff in version .65b.
- Received a remodel in version .65b.
- Light Laser replaced with Kneall Small Laser in version .73b3

## Trivia

- You are able to 1v1 an [Alien Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) if you stay in its blind spot.
