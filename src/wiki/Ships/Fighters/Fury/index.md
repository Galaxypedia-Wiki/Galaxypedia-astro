## Description

The **Fury** is a [Fighter Class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) ship that is highly maneuverable and is able to deal around 200 damage to [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) with a well-aimed Phaser volley. It used to be available in the **[Stormbringer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stormbringer)** and **[Revelation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revelation),** but has since been replaced their respective custom fighters following remodels**.**It can only be found now in a level 4 [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership). A stronger variant of this ship, the **[Starbase Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury),** can be found in the fighter bays of level 2-5 [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).

**Fury** [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) are small and are about the size of a [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp). Furies can fire a volley up to 4 [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) through its 2 [Phaser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) batteries. Its appearance is similar to that of a fighter jet.

## Appearance

The **Fury**'s interior is entered through its cockpit window. Inside, there is a single seat behind a steering column.

## Advantages

- Can deal a great concentration of damage to an enemy's [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) if used correctly.
- Fast and highly maneuverable making it hard for bigger ships to destroy.

## Disadvantages

- Easily hit by [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) with [Light Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Extremely low health.

## Strategy

- **Furies** are usually used to swarm a large ship or provide cover in sieges. A skilled swarm of furies can obliterate a ship's Shield health within 30 seconds, leaving it to be easily finished off. The strategy with **Furies** is to dive-bomb if the target is large, or slow down and wait for your target to move into a vulnerable position if they're too fast or small.
- Deal as much damage as possible before being destroyed by your target. Fire your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) as often as possible.

- Remodeled again in an unknown version.
