{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Raptor_** is the signature [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) of the [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)-class ship [Warlord]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlord).

## Description

The **Raptor** is a fast and well-armed fighter similar to the [Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury). It has both Cannon and Phaser [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). It's a streamlined version of the fury but with better weapons and speed.

## Interior

The **Raptor** has no interior. Like all [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), the cockpit is only barely large enough to surround most of the player.

## Advantages

- Fast [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) reload time.
- Fast enough to easily evade fire.
- Great for diving crippled ships.

## Disadvantages

- Low health.
- Large for a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), making it easier to hit at low speeds.

## Strategy

- Fly into a ship's blind spot and use your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to inflict damage.
- Use your speed to making strafing runs on your target while dodging incoming fire.
- Make sure to assist your fleet by defending against smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) or by pestering larger ones.
- Stay close to your fleet's ships or with a group of other [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters); never go out on your own.

## Version History

- No logged changes.

## Trivia

- Basically a streamlined version of the [Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury) with more [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- The name "**Raptor**" comes from the prehistoric dinosaur the Velociraptor. Raptors were pack hunters, meaning they hunted things together.
- The Raptor is exclusive to the [Warlord]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlord).
- The armament is only a tiny bit worse than the [Banshee]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Banshee), a cruiser which costs 3,500; meaning that this is a very strong fighter.
