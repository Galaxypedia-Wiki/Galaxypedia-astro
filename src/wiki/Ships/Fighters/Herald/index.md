{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Herald_** is a stronger variant of the [Harbinger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger), which used to spawn in the [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus).

## Description

The **Herald** is literally a Harbinger with more health (and medium phasers instead of small phasers).

## Interior

The interior is the same as the [Harbinger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger), obviously.

## Advantages

- Able to effectively engage in combat with both large and small ships due to its variety of weapons.
- Great firepower when [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are used to best ability.
- Massive health compared to most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), at a whopping 6000 total health.
- Very powerful when paired with the Harbingers.

## Disadvantages

- No [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive), meaning it must be released and deployed by the carrier pilot close to the intended target.
- Slower and less maneuverable than most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Low turn speed for a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Only one spawned in the Prometheus at the time.

## Strategy

- Use the same strategies as the [Harbinger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger).

## Version History

- Added in an unknown version, replacing one of the Harbingers in the [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus) (only revealed in-game).
- Shields/Hull increased from 2800 to 3000, 4 Small Phasers changed to 4 Medium Phasers in version .74b14 (only revealed in-game).
- Replaced by another Harbinger in version .75a5, this ship can not be found on any ship anymore.

## Trivia

- Surprisingly, the ship has not actually been removed from the game, however it cannot appear anywhere. Whether it will return is unknown.
