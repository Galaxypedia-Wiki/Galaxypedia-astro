![Old Frenzy
Model(s)](7134A05D-B539-42D9-9B09-01F229CB1038.png "Old Frenzy Model(s)")

## Description

The **Frenzy** is a "stealth" variant of the [Fury]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury).Â It carries four [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), slightly less hull than its sister [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), and more speed. However, the **Frenzy** is a slippery [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), meaning it is very hard to control. It won't go in a straight line if you turn it too hard. People use it in swarms a lot, and it is hard to take out if it manages to get into a blind spot on your ship. It is carried on the [Rhino]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rhino).

## Appearance

The **Frenzy**'s interior is the exact same as the [Fury's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fury) interior. It is entered through the cockpit window and has a seat behind a steering column.

## Advantages

- Because of the speed, you can distract bases effectively.
- [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) can easily wear down enemy [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), allowing anti-hull [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) to deal higher damage.
- Higher speed than a fury.

## Disadvantages

- Low health.
- High speed can make it hard to control.
- Awkward handling.

## Strategy

- If you're in a faction with 4+ members, use the frenzy to take down bigger [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- Stay in the blindspot of enemy [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) to escape being damaged.

## Version History
