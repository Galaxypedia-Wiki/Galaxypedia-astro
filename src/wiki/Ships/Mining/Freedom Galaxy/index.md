The **_Freedom Galaxy_** is a massive, expensive [**Miner**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) released during the [Fourth of July Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-Event-2020).

## Description

The **Freedom Galaxy **is the largest, fastest, and the only [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)-class ship in the game with 5 [Large Patriotic Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It is also one of the most expensive ships in the game, requiring a **[Class A permit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permits)** and ~1 million credits worth of materials.

## Interior

The Freedom Galaxy is a reskin of the [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy), with American themed color palette, various U.S Flags around the ship, and a different trail color.

The Interior of the Freedom Galaxy can be accessed via a teleporter on the docking ramp like the normal [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy). This will take players to a small room with three chairs. On the walls are depictions of the Sickle and Hammer with a slash through them. The center pilot's seat faces three screens. There are 2 more seats on each side of the walls, with numerous displays on them.

## Advantages

- Has the most health out of all [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), and with extreme maneuverability, this allows players to easily escape pirates before being destroyed.
- Has the highest mining rate (87.5 m^3^/s) and farthest mining range (7500) with its 5 [Large Patriotic Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Has the largest Ore Hold in the game (10000m^3^).
- Can make 20k Credits without Loyalty per dump.
- Amazing miner to use for any kind of mining strategies, for example [Boom Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies) and **Outpost spam**.

## Disadvantages

- Huge and bulky making it an easy target for hostile NPCs or other players at war.
- Limited classification and expense means players and entire factions will target you.
- The Mother of all miner kills. One of the largest targets in the game. Hunted by pirates with more ferocity than any other non-combat ship, and even players in your own faction by dock-blocking you.
- <u>**Extremely**</u> expensive to obtain due to the Class A Permit and high value of the ship, making this one of the most expensive ships in the game.

## Strategy

- Don't warp more than 72k away from your base. Each time you warp on big servers, you risk having war declared on you as soon as you start warping.
- It is always **never** a good idea to use this ship in a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Trust few.
- If you are mining in a **Freedom Galaxy** and you get ambushed by combat [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) or [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), your best bet would be to quickly get back to your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and despawn.
- Do not use this as a nuke or a tank; It is limited and massively expensive due to the sheer cost of the Class A Permit.
- If large amounts of high-score players joins an enemy team, you should stay close to your base while mining, so you will have time to dock if the players declare war to destroy your **Freedom Galaxy.**
- Use this ship with extreme caution. Once it's destroyed, it will be **extremely** difficult to reobtain because of the sheer exorbitant cost.

## Version History

- Buffed in version .68b adding another Large Patriotic Mining Laser (60 m3/s>75 m3/s)

- Initial buff: Turn Speed increased from 0.1 to 0.2, and 1 extra Large Patriotic Mining Laser(Had 6 Large Patriotic Mining Lasers) added. This was partially reverted(the extra Large Patriotic Mining Laser was removed), and instead the [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health was nerfed from 7,500/7,500 to 7,000/7,000, the Turn Speed was again increased from 0.2 to 0.3, and turret orientations corrected in version .74b14(?).
- Shields and Hull were increased back to 7,500/7,500 in version .75a10.
