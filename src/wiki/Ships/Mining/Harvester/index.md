{{< shipInfobox >}}

{{< notices/offsale >}}

The **_Harvester_** was the first **[Miner-class ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)** to ever have a [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive). It later also gained a [Medium Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Medium-Mining-Laser)

## Description

The **Harvester**was the first [Warp capable]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) [Miner-class ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) in Galaxy.

It mines as fast as the [Advanced Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Miner) and [Saturn]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Saturn). Its total health of 1800 divides evenly between [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) (900/900). Takes a minimum of 120 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.

## Appearance

The **Harvester** has no interior other than a simple pilot's seat set against a slanted gray wall.

## Advantages

- High mobility.
- Small, making it hard to hit.
- Decent speed.
- The [Medium Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) provides a considerable range, and the [Tiny Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) allow short-range harvesting.
- Very affordable [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).

## Disadvantages

- Low health pool.
- Small Ore Hold.
- Slow Acceleration and Deceleration.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miner-class ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Awful Model

## Strategy

- Make sure to constantly check for hostile ships heading in your direction. Constantly check your [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap).
- Watch out if you're at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), you're likely to be ambushed.
- Don't mine at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) if you are at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) and you aren't protected.

## Version History
