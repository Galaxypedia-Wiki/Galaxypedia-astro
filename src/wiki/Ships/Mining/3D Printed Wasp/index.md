The **_3D Printed Wasp_** is a [**Limited ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) which was available during the April Fool's 2020 Event.

## Description

The **3D Printed Wasp** is a Ship which was released during the [2020 April Fool's Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2020). Like its normal counterpart, the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp), it is classed as a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).

## Advantages

- Very fast.

## Disadvantages

- Only 1 [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields)-breaking [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) means that it has trouble against [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)-based ships such as the [Invictus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Invictus).
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Despite being a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), it has no [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and has no ore hold.

## Strategy

- Never use this [ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) during wartime. Consider it a collectible.

## Version History

- 3D Printed Colossus Gun damage heavily buffed in version .69a2.
- 1 [3D Printed Colossus Gun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replaced with 1 [Light Ice Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .71b.
- 1 [Light Ice Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replaced with 1 [3D Printed Colossus Gun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and reclassed from [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) to [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) in version .71c.

## Trivia

- Has a similar name and shares common points with the [3D Printed Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}3D-Printed-Warlock).
- Its [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) is larger than the ship itself.
- The first to lose a **3D Printed Wasp** was Dragonq2015 to ELITEGAMEZ321's [3D Printed Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}3D-Printed-Warlock)
- The Turret looks oddly disproportional compared the size of the ship itself.
- Meshing is currently broken and you have to teleport to the ship to get in it.
- Currently the only miner with specifically combat turret.
- Used to be unspawnable anywhere but your own base.
- Despite being classed as a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), it does not have any [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
