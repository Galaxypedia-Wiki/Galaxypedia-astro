The **_Wasp_** is a **[Miner-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)** ship and is one of the starter ships for Galaxy.

## Description

The **Wasp** is a free [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)-class ship, which is automatically given to all new players in Galaxy upon first joining the game. If destroyed it must be rebuilt in the ship build menu under the Miner tab. Compared to other [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), it is lacking in terms of mining speed and ore hold, and has a small mining range of 4500 studs. The **Wasp** is also used for distracting base [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) because it has a high top speed and players are not afraid to lose it. **Wasps** cost nothing and can be rebuilt immediately upon destruction, allowing players to respawn them indefinitely.

## Appearance

The **Wasp** is a strangely designed "ship" featuring a pair of headlights, a grille resembling that of a combustion engine car in front of a small generator, a seat for the pilot, and two tiny thrusters on the back for propulsion.

## Advantages

- Fairly fast and very small, making it hard to hit and somewhat useful for distracting heavier turrets.
- Always free to build.

## Disadvantages

- Slowest mining speed of any obtainable [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) class ship, along with the shortest range.
- Lowest health pool in the class.
- Tiny [Ore]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) Hold of 250.
- Often targeted by [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), like many other [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Very small explosion value of 3.

## Strategy

- If you have a level 1 warehouse, you do not have to worry about safety or losing your ship (to non AI) due to New Player Immunity.
- Try mining in a peaceful [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) or the U.N.E. faction to reduce your risk of being killed by other players.
- Stay close to friendly combat ships when possible, as they can serve as help and protect you from enemies. This is less reliable than with other mining ships, however, since most people won't care to protect a free ship.
- If you are mining in a faction that is at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) (which is not recommended), try staying close to your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), so you can dock as fast as possible.
- Don't mine at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) if you are at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) and you aren't protected. (Unless you have new player protection).
- This ship is free, so you can take any risks, just remember that if you are destroyed, you lose all the ore in your ore hold.
- Due to the ship being small and fast, the ship can be used to scout enemy fleets for wars. The ship is also good for this task because there is no risk if you lose the ship as it's free, meaning you can easily spam this ship as a distraction.
- You can distract player ships with this. Despite Wasps being free and worthless to destroy, many people will decide to shoot them for fun, which means they aren't shooting something valuable.

## Version History

- Received a remodel in version .56b.
- [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) added in version .61h1?.
- Received a trail and a remodel in version .66b.

## Trivia

- Along with the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm), it is automatically given to any new player.
- Galaxy players used to engage in "wasp duels" wherein Wasps would combat each other to their destruction, and were popular due to the comedically poor combat ability of the ship, as well as the no-risk nature of battling with free ships. These duels became effectively impossible when the shield regeneration mechanic was introduced as the regeneration now outpaces the Wasp's DPS.
- Commonly used to attempt to glitch ships such as [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). This is **bannable** as stated in the [Galaxy Rules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Rules).
- Occasionally used to block the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) of larger ships during sieges, due to its status as a free ship allowing it to be destroyed at no cost, although it is fairly hard.
- Smallest [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) currently in Galaxy, and one of the smallest ships of any kind in the game.
- Brings in about 312 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) without any [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty) per run, but can earn up to 562 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits).
- This ship has eight limited variants, in the form of the [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp), the [Festive Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp), the [Prototype X-3]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-3), the [Blue Torp Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blue-Torp-Wasp), the [Patriotic Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Wasp), the [3D Printed Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}3D-Printed-Wasp), the [Waspinator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator), and the [Wasp?]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp?)
- Used in the mining tutorial of the game.
- The **Wasp** was originally called a Mining Frigate in Pre-Alpha.
- One of only two free and continuously available ships in the game, the other being the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm).
- Lowest health out of all non-limited ships, excluding [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- The Wasp is often jokingly referred to by the Galaxy community as "The best ship" due to being possibly the weakest ship in the game.

<!-- -->

- Arguably the most cost-efficient combat ship, due to the fact that it's free and can deal damage, giving it theoretically infinite damage per credit spent. However, Wasp spam isn't practical in reality due to its extremely low DPS and health, with most ships regenerating shield health faster than it can damage them, including the wasp itself.
- The Wasp is one of few ships small enough to get into the Mega Base by threading through the dock doorways.
- Had a unique reskin for the [Easter event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Easter-event-2022) along with the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm).
