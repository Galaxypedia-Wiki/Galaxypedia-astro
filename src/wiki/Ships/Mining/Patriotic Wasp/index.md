The **_Patriotic Wasp_** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [**Miner**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) from the [2021 Fourth of July Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-2021).

## Description

The **Patriotic Wasp** is a limited variant the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) equipped with a [Patriotic Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Appearance

According to Yname, the **Patriotic Wasp**'s model was accidentally deleted with other Patriotic ship models. It featured a red, white, and blue color scheme but otherwise remains largely unchanged relative to the regular Wasp.

## Advantages

- Large mining laser allows for fast mining compared to the Wasp.
- Like the Wasp, it's small and fast and capable of escaping dire situations if needed.

## Disadvantages

- Somewhat low ore hold.
- Somewhat low health.
- Limited class means it'll be targeted by pirates.

## Strategies

- Do not mine at war at all, it's a limited ship and there is a very high probability it'll be targeted.
- Mine close to your base to ensure that if any enemies are coming, that you can dock quickly and respawn.
- Check the mini-map often, look out for any alien or pirate ships that are around.

## Version History

- Had it's [Large Patriotic Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) swapped out for a [Patriotic Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), increased the range from 6,175 to 6,500 in version .75a10.

## Trivia

- When fired, the Patriotic Mining Laser pushes the Patriotic Wasp due to the Wasp being tiny.
