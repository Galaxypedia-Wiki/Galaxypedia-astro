The **_Commercial Miner_** is a somewhat expensive but fast [**Miner**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)

## Description

The **Commercial Miner** is a [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) ship with very little interior but a large Ore Hold, designed to mine multiple [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) at once with fair efficiency. It is a large jump in price from the more affordable [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) like the [Saturn]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Saturn). It takes a minimum of 240 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.

## Appearance

The **Commercial Miner** has almost no interior. There is just a large glass cockpit with one seat, no detail, and a floor with a metallic texture. The [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) docks with the cockpit facing the terminal.

## Advantages

- 5 [Small Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) provide quick mining speeds.
- Decent amount of health.
- Large Ore Hold.
- Can mine multiple [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) at once.
- High speed for its size.
- High survivability because of its speed and decent amount of health.

## Disadvantages

- Relatively expensive.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Fairly large for its class and easy to hit.
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) may declare [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) in order to destroy a more expensive and loot-filled [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- [Small Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) have shorter range compared to [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Strategy

- Check the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) every 30 seconds for pirates or other foes.
- Try to mine near your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) to decrease the chance of your ship being shot down.
- Never mine in a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Mine in a Private Server if you have access to one.

## Trivia

- Many players skip this [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) due to its disadvantages.
