{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Saturn_** is an affordable **[Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)** class ship with two [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Description

The **Saturn** has the sixth-quickest mining speed out of all standard [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) ships in the game due to its two [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). The ship has low health, only being able to withstand a few hits from [Medium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Heavy weapons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) before being destroyed. Physically, the ship has four main thrusters behind the bridge, four large containers for [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), and a tapered front end resembling an old model of the [Advanced Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Miner). It takes a minimum of 150 seconds to fill up its hold.

## Appearance

The **Saturn** interior consists only of a short, yellow and gray hallway separated from the pilot's seat by a team-colored "door." The pilot's seat is about as tall as the player, black and gray in color, and faces an empty, gray room.

## Advantages

- Sixth fastest mining speed in the game.
- Sixth largest [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) hold in the game.
- The two [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) have a range of 5500 studs, the same as the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual).
- Affordable.

## Disadvantages 

- Low [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) for its size.
- Same mining speed as the [Advanced Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Miner) which costs around 2k [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) less.
- Can be easily destroyed if too far from a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase)/ the [Megabase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).

## Strategy

- Check if any enemies are coming every 30 seconds, either by looking around or on the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap).
- Always mine in a peaceful faction to ensure safe [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining).
- If in a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), check enemy locations every 30 seconds to avoid destruction of your [Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- If an [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) ship or an enemy ship is approaching you, head back to base.
- If an [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) ship is targeting your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) while you are mining, stay where you are.

<!-- -->

- Don't mine at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) during [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), especially without protection.

- Brings in about 1875 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) without any [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty) per run, but can earn up to 3375.
- Used to be the biggest [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), before the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual), [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth), and [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca) came.
- A top pick for new players because of its low cost and high credit output as it will out pay its cost in 3 runs.
- Used to be called the "Industrial Miner" and had a nicknamed called "Ind Miner".
