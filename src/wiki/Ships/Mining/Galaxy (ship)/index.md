{{< shipInfobox >}}

The**_Galaxy_** is a VIP **[Miner-]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)[class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)** ship and the 4th best of its class (It be obtained without VIP via a [Harbourmaster]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbourmaster)). It is the best non-limited miner in the game.

## Description

The **Galaxy**is the 2nd largest, 4rd fastest harvesting (43 m^3^/s) and one of two [Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) Class ships within the game (The other being a limited counterpart, the [Freedom Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Galaxy)) with 2 [Large Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Large Advanced Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It takes a minimum of about 2 minutes & 46 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.

## Appearance

The interior of the Galaxy can be accessed via teleporter on the docking ramp. This will take players to a small room with three chairs. The center pilot's seat faces three screens. To the left of the door that teleports players back outside the ship is a polygonal wolf/bear graphic.

## Advantages

- Has the 3rd highest mining rate with its 2 Large Mining Lasers and 2 Large Advanced Mining Lasers, first being [Freedom Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Galaxy), second [Woolly Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Woolly-Mammoth), and third Maple Orca.
- Has the 2nd largest Ore Hold in the game, with an [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) Capacity of 8,000.
- Can get around 200-300k [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) per hour mining on a **Galaxy**.
- On **33** [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty) you can make 30k [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) per dump.
- Turrets have a long range.

## Disadvantages

- All Turrets are top-mounted, requiring the ship to be below or in front (at an angle) of Ores and Materials.
- The most expensive build menu VIP Miner, and a prime target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Huge, bulky, and slow, making it an easy target.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often attack Miners like the **Galaxy**.
- Extremely expensive Uranium cost, a rare and expensive ore.
- Extremely expensive if you do not have the [VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass), as the non-VIP quest costs 600 thousand credits and an additional 4 data shards, 2 antimatter shards, and 1 quantum core.
- Has an explosion value of 300.

## Strategy

- Don't mine during a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- If you are mining in a **Galaxy** and you get ambushed by combat [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) or [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), your best bet at escape would be to quickly get retreat to the closest non-enemy [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or **Planet** (via warp) and despawn. (Do not over-estimate the health of the **Galaxy**. Just because it has high health doesn't mean you can simply ignore your enemies)
- Do not use this as a nuke. This ship has a small explosion radius compared to it's price.
- Do not use this as a tank, it is not worth it.
- The mining lasers have a range of 6.5k. Additionally, you can utilize the various ship angles to have all of your turret's mining, this is due to the overwhelming length of the Galaxy.
- Beware of warp traps and dock blocks.

## Trivia

- One of the very few ships that has an [admin-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) counterpart ([Maple Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Maple-Galaxy)).
- The **Galaxy** was previously the only non-Super Capital Advanced Ship that was constantly available; all others were part of a quest that changes monthly.
- Alongside the [Festive Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp), [Freedom Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Galaxy), and the [Patriotic Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Rorqual) (if you count the Patriotic Mining Lasers), the **Galaxy** is the fourth of its class to have Large Mining Lasers.
- Used to be the eighth most expensive ship in the game.
- jay4444444444, the same person to be the first to lose a [Cyber Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyber-Leviathan), was also the first person to lose a **Galaxy** (to an Alien).
- Used to be the only Miner that must be bought from a ship quest requestor.
- Based off the design of the Leviathan from Fractured Space.
- Used to Cost 27,500 ROBUX to buy enough Credits.
- It would take you 50 runs to afford the material of the **Galaxy** with an Orca, assuming that you can dump for 8,500 Credits.
- Only gives $538,097 Credits if you sell it.
- You can make more than 10,000 Credits per run with this ship, even with low [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty), and can make more than 12,000 Credits per run at 30% Loyalty.
- If you have 20% Loyalty or more, you can start transfer dumping to make way more Credits than normal. With 30% Loyalty you make around 20-24K Credits.
- You obtain 61 [Score]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Score) per dump in this vessel.
- Shortly before the remodel that gave the Galaxy its current model, the main part of the hull was removed by Confinium in a fit of rage after having been caught selling ships to players for Robux[^1]. This made it so that players had to teleport to the ship's controls due to 90% of the ship being gone.
- The **Galaxy** was the most expensive miner ever until Freedom Galaxy came out, and even then, it remains the most expensive non-event miner.
- For a while, the **Galaxy** was made unobtainable as of .70a due to the mining/economy rebalance update. Any miner above the 6.5k ore hold limit including **Galaxy** and Freedom Galaxy were unobtainable and **lost forever** if destroyed, even if you submitted a refund request because of dockblocking, glitches, etc. During this time, most galaxies brave enough to mine in public servers were subsequently dock blocked.
  - As of Feb. 18th, 2021, players may [trade their **Galaxy** or Freedom Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}User-blog:Explodabat/Galaxy-Exchanges-Reference) for other ships with a total value less than or equal to 90% of the :shipcost price of the **Galaxy.** This can be done in the [Galaxy Discord](https://discord.com/invite/FCGGXvk) in the [#galaxy-exchanges channel](https://discord.com/channels/204965774618656769/812043152562192384/812049361395253368)(NOTE: The Galaxy Exchange channel is probably obsolete due to the Galaxy being available again).
  - When the **Galaxy** and [Freedom Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Galaxy) became obtainable again, those who had lost the former or the latter to dockblocking, glitches, bugs, etc., were unable to request a refund to have the ship added back to their inventory, due to a decision to not retroactively modify or accept new refunds for ships lost during the period where said ships were entirely unobtainable.
    - The above has changed since February 17th, 2023, as anyone who lost either ship illegitimately during the time that the ships were not refundable are eligible to have the ship refunded[^2].
