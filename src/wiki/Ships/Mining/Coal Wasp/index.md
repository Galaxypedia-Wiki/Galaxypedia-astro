The **_Coal Wasp_** is a Limited Event version of the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) known for its incredible speed.

## Description

The **Coal Wasp** is a Limited Event ship, a reskin of the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp).

The exterior is black and the boosters in the back are white. It is equipped with one [Coal Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), just like a normal Wasp. It also has a unique part texture in honor of the "Coal" theme.

You could only get this ship by asking a [Galaxy Admin]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff) on Christmas during the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event 2017</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017).

## Appearance

Like the Wasp, the **Coal Wasp** has little interior.

## Advantages

- Extremely high Top Speed, currently one the fastest non-admin ships in the game, maxing out at 500.
- Hard to hit.

## Disadvantages

- 2nd lowest health of any ship ever in Galaxy, with 30 total health, only behind [Kodiak A]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak-A) with 2 total health; one hit <u>**FROM ALMOST ANYTHING**</u> and it's over.
- Dies instantly to a small amount of [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), which usually target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- The Turn Speed is low compared to its Top Speed, making the handling of the **Coal Wasp** somewhat awkward.
- Virtually useless; it's nothing more than a nice trophy ship.

## Strategy

- Treat this ship like a trophy.
- Ask someone if they wanted coal for Christmas. They'll love this piece of coal.

## Version History

- Added in Update .60a.
- Received a buff in Update .60d that boosted Top Speed from 175 to 500.
- Warp Drive added in version .61h1?
- Top Speed nerfed from 500 to the maximum top speed in an unknown version (500 > 400 > 380)
- Put on the "Limited Editions (Permit)" build menu on version .73a3, now also requiring a Class E Permit.
- Shields/Hull increased from 5/5 to 15/15, ore hold increased from 5 to 1000, small mining laser replaced with coal mining laser in version .73b3.

## Trivia

- Could only be obtained once via Admins.
- It is now unobtainable and under 100 or so still exist.
- Galaxy Admins would give players this along with the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Festive Wasp</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp) on Christmas Day during the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event 2017</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017).
- This ship is considered a meme because of its insane Top Speed (of 380), and extremely low total health (30).
- One of the few limited event ships available for only one day including the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Festive Wasp</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp), [2018 Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}2018-Ship) (surprise Raffle ship on Discord), and the [United States of Razor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-States-of-Razor).
- [Gatling Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are the only [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in the game that won't one-shot this ship.
- Was one of the only ships without a [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) for the longest time after its release, although it eventually obtained one alongside every other miner-class ship in version .61h1?
