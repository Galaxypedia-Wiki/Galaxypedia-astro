{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_M Class_** was a very specialized **[Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)** and physically was one of the largest ships in Galaxy.

## Description

The **M Class** was a very large [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) that was added in .60d. It came equipped with 2 of its unique [M Class Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), 6000 Ore Hold, and 400 Cargo Hold. It had a high amount of [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) but a low amount of [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), making it vulnerable to [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating). It also moved quite slowly when not in [Warp.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) It took a minimum of 157 seconds to fill up its hold. It was very easy to obtain the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca) with this miner.

## Appearance

To enter the **M Class**, you must walk across the glowing path to the "door" teleporter. Upon walking on the teleporter, you will enter a large, mostly empty, room. There are lots of windows in front and around the seat in the middle, as well as a hologram, stating: "All systems Online". If you jump through the "door" right next to the teleporter, you will enter a secret room.

## Advantages

- Great way of making money. It can make lots of credits if used in sync with the [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class).
- Decent [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Great turn speed for its size.
- Large Cargo Hold for a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Decently high explosion value for its cost at 160 (or 1.6k explosion radius; and 6.4k explosion damage at the epicenter).
- Relatively decent top speed for a ship of its size.
- Most [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) deal mostly [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage, which is useful considering this ship has terrible shield health but high [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health.

## Disadvantages

- Incredibly low health compared to its size.
- Slow top speed.
- Huge size makes it a prime target, even from far away.
- Quite expensive.
- Cannot mine at a distance; the ore must be inside the "mouth" of the ship. In other words, it has the shortest mining range.
- A jackpot for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating), especially [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) with a large Cargo Hold.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- It has a hard time docking when there are two M-Classes, they can't dock next to each other, and you have to move so your auto dock actually docks.
- Prevents people on the same faction from attacking the enemy-captured [Derelict Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Derelict-Station) or [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base) if inside the "Mouth" of the **M Class**.
- Due to the size and maneuverability along with the not too ideal overall health, the **M Class** is very prone to being pirated and easily destroyed by even smaller ships like the [Aeaphiel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aeaphiel) or a couple of [Centurions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion); do not take unnecessary risks by mining far away from the nearest base/planet you can dock at, where there is a considerable risk that other players may declare a surprise war on your team, leaving you with little opportunity to escape and de-spawn in time.

## Strategy

- Drive over an [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), stop, and mine away.
- Don't mine at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War). If you do, check the chat and [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) every 15--30 seconds.
- Always be aware of your surroundings. You will be a massive target.
- If you're being chased, warp towards a strong [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) owned by your faction. The [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on a strong base often ward off attacking [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships). Failure to warp to a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) will most likely result in destruction.
- Try not to do things while [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining). The ship will mine a full-size [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) chunk in about 20 seconds.
- Due to the recent [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) cost nerfs, this ship is a somewhat viable nuking ship in terms of cost-effectiveness. Don't try to nuke anything that has a sizeable amount of [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) HP, though.

## Version History

- Received a nerf in .60d that reduced this ship's [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) by 2, Hull by 500, Cargo Hold By 50, Ore Hold by 1750, and ship cost by around $80K
- Received a nerf in an unknown version that added transparent plates to the front and back, obstructing line-of-sight outside of the "mining hole" to prevent the [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) from [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) outside of the ship.
- Received a massive buff in .61e4 that doubled its health and added *some*damage resistance.
- Received a buff in .61h1 that replaced its 4 [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) with 2 [Large Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It was also made cheaper.
- Explosion range decreased from 150 to 110 in .65b.
- Remodeled in version .66b and added with 2 M Class mining lasers.
- Remodeled in version .67c.
- Model upscaled significantly, 2 M Class Mining Lasers changed to 4 M Class Mining Lasers, and Ore Hold increased from 4000 to 6000 in version .74b14(?).
- Loses 2 out of its 4 M Class Mining Lasers, however it's damage output nearly doubled, going from 105 to 198 damage in version .75a10.

## Trivia

- While docked, the old **M Class** model blocked large ships from docking next to it, earning it the nickname "_Dock-Blocking Device_" or "_DBD_".
- The first [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) in the game that requires ores to be mined _inside_ the ship.
- The **M Class** originally had 8 [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in its testing phase, cost over 400K, had 12K ore hold and required twice the materials necessary to build the [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx).
- The **M Class** was originally called The Spinach.
- The **M Class** is a joke to most players, often being called things like "Meme Class" and "Microwave Class".

<!-- -->

- There are multiple cat decals all over the ship. One can be found under the entrance bridge and another hiding in the interior on the doorway.
- At the time of its addition, the **M Class** was one of just 3 [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) to have [Warp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive), aside from the [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth) and [Harvester]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvester). The former, however, was [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) exclusive and the latter was cheap and made little money, making it special as the only large, non-[VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) to have [Warp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) before .61h. After .61h however, all [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) were given [Warp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive), mitigating this special advantage.
- It often earns over 6K credits per mining run with a full [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) hold.
- The **M Class** was the first [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) to ever have [Large Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Was tied with the [Patriotic Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Rorqual) for fastest [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) until the [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy) was added.
- Used to be the most targeted [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) due to its size and speed until the warp update.
- Earns 1 Million credits after ~7.2 hours of mining (excluding loyalty curve and non-productive time)
- Players constantly debate whether the M Class or [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual) is the better miner. In these debates, the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual) usually wins due to its larger ore hold, higher combined HP, the fact that it can mine three asteroids at a time, and it doesn't require the player to constantly move around. The M Class does however mine ore faster due to its large mining lasers, but as it also has 500 less ore hold, it makes less money per ore dump.
- The M Class used to be able to fit the model of [Myriad III]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad-III) inside of it.

<!-- -->

- One of the biggest [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) in the game.

<!-- -->

- It's older model looked like a Bolt
- The M Class stands for Miner Class, as it's the fitting name for this ship.
- Before .68b update, it was able to "eat" Lvl. 1 to 4 Starbases, due to their simple and small model. It was able to nuke these bases easier, however it is able to "eat" Derelict Station and Freedom Base.
- Has a secret room behind the door next to the teleporter. The [Santa's Workshop]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Santa's-Workshop) also contains this secret.
