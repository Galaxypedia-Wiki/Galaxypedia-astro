The**_Patriotic Rorqual_** is a **[Miner-]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)**[class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) ship and a reskin of the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual).

## Description  

The **Patriotic Rorqual** was released as a July 4th Event ship. There are special features that set it apart from the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual). Equipped with 4 [Patriotic Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), with 6,500 stud range it makes Patriotic Rorqual overall a much more efficient miner than the normal [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual). The mining and money making potential is higher than the [M Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}M-Class). Since the **Patriotic Rorqual** values capitalism so much, it doesn't change to the faction color due to the power of America by its side. Takes a minimum of ~156 seconds to fill up its hold.

## Interior 

The **Patriotic Rorqual** has an interior very similar to that of the original [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual). However, the left and right walls are a pure, bright blue, the back and front walls are white, and the floor is covered in dark red carpet. The pilots' seat is white and has a control panel directly in front of it, ending with the panel having colorful buttons & a picture of John F. Kennedy on the top side.

## Advantages 

- High health for a Miner.
- Faster than [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual).
- Large range (6500 studs).

## Disadvantages 

- Slow and large, making it vulnerable coupled with the fact that it has no defenses.
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) and [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) (player) are more likely to target you because of the fact that the **Patriotic Rorqual** is extremely rare.
- Despite being rare and expensive, the **Patriotic Rorqual** is outmatched by the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca)'s mining speed and Ore Hold.

## Strategy 

- Don't mine in [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Avoid factions that are vulnerable to War.
- Utilize your high health for tanking out attacks from Aliens and keep on mining.
- If possible, mine in a [VIP Server]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Servers) to avoid pirating players. However, Aliens still do spawn.
- Try to check your map every 20 seconds for [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) and other enemies.
- Try to find a [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) that has a lot of [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) clusters around its [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and not as many [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- If you are mining in a Faction that is at War, only mine near your Starbase.
- Due to the fact that it is a limited ship use it rarely.
