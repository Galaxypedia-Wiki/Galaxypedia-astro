## Description

The **Advanced Miner** is a Miner with four Small Mining Lasers. This allows it to mine [Asteroids]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) at double the rate of a [Tango]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tango), It has a health pool of 2200, divided rather evenly between [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) (1000/1200) respectively. It has a mining range of approximately 4000 studs. It takes a minimum of 100 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.
