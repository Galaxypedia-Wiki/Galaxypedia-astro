The **_Mammoth_** is one of the only VIP [**Miners**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) in the game. It is an experimental extension of the Rorqual, according to its description.

## Description

The **Mammoth** is essentially an upgrade to the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual) (as referenced in the build menu description). It mines and accelerates faster, though its turn speed is lower than the Rorqual's. The Mammoth costs more, requires a higher warehouse level, and is VIP-exclusive. All other stats are the same as the Rorqual's. It has a mining range of 5500 and takes a minimum of 250 seconds to fill its hold.

## Appearance

The **Mammoth** has a very large interior for its class. The ship is entered through a small stairway at the stern of the ship. From there, a long hallway leads to the main room, containing the pilot's seat and many screens. Another small stairway at the center of the room will take the player downstairs into two smaller rooms. One room is a sleeping quarter, while the other is a small office.

## Advantages

- Very fast for a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) of its size.
- Higher health than the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual), getting near to the total HP of the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca); allowing it to sustain more damage than most other miners.
- Mines faster than the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual), as fast as the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca).
- Large ore hold, same as the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca).
- Significantly cheaper than the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca), despite having the same effective mining efficiency as that ship.

## Disadvantages

- [VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) is required.
- The large size makes it a large target, but it is still smaller than the [M Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}M-Class).
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), especially those as large of a target as the Mammoth.
- Quite expensive for its class.
- Has less turn speed than the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual), and isn't as durable as the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca).

## Strategy

- Never mine during a [war]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}war).
- Use the [warp drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) if attacked, and watch the chat or [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) for [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) declarations or incoming [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating). It is recommended to do a check like this at least a few times a minute.
- Try to mine in a [VIP Server]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Servers) to avoid pirating players. Be aware that [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) can still spawn in these servers.
- Don't mine at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) if at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) and are unprotected. It's not worth it, even with the ability to warp.
- It's better to mine at large clusters of ores since they are easily harvested and the [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) will not be out of range when mining.

## Trivia

- There is a banner in the back of the ship, showing the wolf of House Stark, from Game Of Thrones.
- It was the second [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) to ever have a [Warp Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive). The first was the [Harvester]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvester).
- It's the first [VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) _utility_ ship, with the second one being the [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy).
- A lot of people without [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) got it before it was enforced in the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017).
- Brings in around 6500 credits without any [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty) per run.
- Along with the [Woolly Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Woolly-Mammoth), it was the largest [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) (by model size) in the game for a short time.
- During the [Christmas Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017), this got a "reskin" as the [Woolly Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Woolly-Mammoth), which is the most expensive ship in the entire game (mainly due to the crazy high cost of the Class A Permit).
- It was repeatedly nerfed upon release to balance it.
- Used to be the most expensive [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), but has since been replaced by the [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy) and the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca).
- The **Mammoth** was the first [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) in the game with _more_ than four [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) (The ship currently has 4 [Mammoth Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets)).
