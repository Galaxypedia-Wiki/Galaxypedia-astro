{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Tango_** is a small and fast early-game [**Miner**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)-class ship.

## Description

The **Tango** is a cheap [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)-class ship that is equipped with two [Small Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). Its health totals at 1000 and is divided evenly between [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) (500/500). Its [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) have a range of 4500 studs. Takes a minimum of 100 seconds to fill up its hold.

## Appearance

The minuscule interior of the **Tango** consists of a dome that houses the cockpit. Assorted crates and a screen are spread in this cramped room.

## Advantages

- Very low cost.
- New players can use this to make a decent profit.
- Good speed for a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- If used by a player with a level one [warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}warehouse), it is immune to all damage.
- Explosion Radius of 25
- It can be obtained for free once with the [code]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Codes) TANGO.

## Disadvantages

- Low health. (1500 total HP).
- Somewhat slow mining speed.
- Limited Cargo and Ore Hold.
- Targeted by [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) due to the low health pool.

## Strategy

- Make sure to check for any enemies every 30 seconds, either by looking around or on the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap).
- Always mine in a peaceful faction to ensure safety from players.
- Always make sure your faction has strong allies.
- Don't mine at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) during a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- When [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) is declared, quickly turn back to the closest base and despawn.

### Safety

- Don't mine near [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) or [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates), and dock if one starts coming closer.
- Never mine at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) unless your [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse) is level one.
- If [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), check the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) every 30 seconds; however, it can be very foolish to insist on mining during a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- If mining at war, stay close to your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) for protection.

## Version History

- There is a type of dance (or dance style) the ship is named after; the [Tango](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango).
