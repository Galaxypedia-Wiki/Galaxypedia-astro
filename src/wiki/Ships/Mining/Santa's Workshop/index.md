The **_Santa's Workshop_** is a large reskin of the [**Miner-class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) [M Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}M-Class) added during the [2020 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2020).

## Description

The **Santa's Workshop** is a reskin and buffed variant of the [M Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}M-Class) which was released in part 2 of the 2020 Christmas Event, and then re-released in part 1 of the [2021 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021).

## Interior

The **Santa's Workshop** shares its interior with the M Class, except for some color changes and a Christmas tree.

## Advantages

- Can mine entire [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) extremely fast with its 5 [M Class Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Great turn speed for its size.
- Large Cargo Hold for a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Makes 6K credits in 1 run with 6% [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty). (If you are skilled with warping, 1 run takes around 6 minutes.)
- 2nd-best refundable miner in the game, with the [Woolly Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Woolly-Mammoth) being 1st.
- Has more health than its non-limited variant, allowing it to survive longer against pirates and aliens.

## Disadvantages

- Huge size makes it a prime target, even from far away.
- Cannot mine at a distance; the ore must be inside the "mouth" of the ship.
- A jackpot for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating), especially [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) with a large Cargo Hold.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- It has a hard time docking when there are two **Santa's Workshops**, as they can't dock next to each other, and you have to move so your auto dock actually docks.
- Prevents people on the same faction from attacking the enemy's starbase if inside the "Mouth" of the **Santa's Workshop** (such use may break rules).
- Very expensive, being more than quintuple the cost of a regular [M Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}M-Class); it also costs 100 snowflakes, which can take a while to get.
- In a test against the Orca, it made money overall about 90% as fast as orca did. This is due to needing to have ores inside the Ship.

## Strategy

- Drive over an [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), stop, and mine away.
- Don't mine at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Always be aware of your surroundings. You will be a massive target.
- If you're being chased, warp towards a strong [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) owned by your faction. The [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on a strong base often ward off attacking [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships). Failure to warp to a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) will most likely result in destruction.
- Try not to become distracted while [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining). The ship will mine a full-size [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) chunk in about 20 seconds.

## Version History

- Shields increased from 1000 to 4000, Hull reduced from 3000 to 2500, Ore Hold increased from 4500 to 6500 and size increased in version .70a.
- Top Speed buffed to 70 and Ore Hold reverted to 4500 to meet ship refund requirements.
- Model upscaled, Top Speed increased from 72 to 150, Turn Speed increased from 0.5 to 0.6, mining armament changed from 3 M Class Mining Lasers to 5 M Class Mining Lasers, and Ore Hold increased from 6000 to 8000 in version .74b14(?).
- Shields reduced from 4,000 to 3,000 and Hull increased from 2,500 to 4,000 in version .75a10.

## Trivia

- This ship was re-introduced during the [2021 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021).
- Most consider this ship to not be worth getting, as it's time-consuming to gather snowflakes, has a mediocre design, and has very low utility if one already owns a better miner.
- If you time it correctly, the Workshop can get stuck in any solid object, including ores.
- Despite it being mentioned that the ore hold was increased to 6500, it was actually increased to 7000.
- There is a hidden room in the Santa's Workshop located behind the door next to the inner teleporter (Discovered by lord1of2coaos).
