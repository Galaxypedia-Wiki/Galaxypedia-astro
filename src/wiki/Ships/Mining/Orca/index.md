The **Orca** is a heavy [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)-Class ship.

## Description

The Orca is the second-best non-limited Miner in the ship building menu, but it is not as good as the famous [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy). It features 6 [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), the most for a non-VIP, and non-Event.

Note that the Orca is the best non-VIP, and non-Limited ship, making it very recommended.

Sometimes seen in public servers, though not very often.

## Appearance

The Orca is one of the few Miners in the game to feature a proper interior. Featuring a seat with many keys and computers around it, many crates, 2 radar screens, 2 lockers and 4 co-pilot seats with screens.

## Advantages

- Great armament of Mining Lasers.
- 2nd best non-limited
- High health tank, making a low number of small ships a minor threat.
- The best regularly obtainable miner, and the third-fastest refundable miner, with the [Woolly Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Woolly-Mammoth) being 1st and [Santa's Workshop]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Santa's-Workshop) being 2nd.
- Rather high top-speed relative to its size.
- Takes a minimum of just over 3 minutes to fill its ore hold.
- Has twice the mining speed of the Rorqual.
- Due to its size and turret placement, it can actually mine, 5900-6.5k forwards.
- Can make 100k-130k [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) per hour if you are efficient, making it very good with the more experienced player.

## Disadvantages

- Terrible maneuverability aside from the top speed. Not much of a problem with warp.
- Massive target, allowing [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to hit it with ease.
- Requires a level 8 warehouse to build, which is expensive for a new player.
- Requires 2000 [Uranium,]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) a rare and expensive ore.
- Due to its size and turret placement, it can only shoot 4100--4300 studs backwards.
- Slow docking speed. Very annoying if you are trying to escape a NPC or enemy player.
- A huge target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) due to being the second-best [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) on the build menu, though

## Strategy

- Don't mine during a war.
- Find large ore fields to fill your ore hold quickly.
- Warp away from aliens, as they sometimes chase you. If it is a Punisher, your best bet would be to rush back to your Starbase and despawn. The Starbase can finish it off, even if it is level 1.

## Trivia

- The **Orca** takes inspiration from the EVE Online ship of the same name
- Previously was a better nuke than the [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class), basically one of the best ship [nukes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#"Nuking") in the game, along with [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy) and Prototypes. This was especially effective in [Galaxy Arcade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Arcade) because it could be spawned at any base.
- Can make around 8.5k-10k per run depending on loyalty.
- Killing an Orca with 0 bounty gives a 40k bounty increase, making this a nice target for pirates.
- Used to cost about 166,032.2 credits after buying enough uranium. The 5,000 uranium costs 110,000 credits?.
- Used to cost 15,000 uranium, making the Orca cost nearly 700,000 credits. It was cut down to 5000 Uranium shortly after, and it now costs 2,000 uranium.
- The **Orca's** explosion damage was nerfed many times due to dealing too much damage, the original pre-nerf explosion damage can deal about 7000 damage to a starbase, it was then nerfed to about 3000 damage to a starbase, and then nerfed yet again to about 1000 damage to a starbase, these nerfs were not mentioned when the explosion damage nerfs happened.
- It takes about 45 runs with a [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth) or [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual) if you are doing it with credits and takes about 4 hours to get it with those ships
- the fastest way to get an Orca is to sell the M class, and get 13k more credits. you can loot to make the process faster.
- It takes about 4 minutes and 20 seconds for one mining run with this insane miner.
- As of version .75a10, The Orca is the only miner with a total of 0 Cargo Hold
