{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Rorqual_** is a popular **[Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)**-Class ship commonly seen in Galaxy.

## Description

The **Rorqual** is the fifth most expensive and the fifth largest of all non-limited [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships). It has 3 [Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It can mine fairly fast and can fit a substantial amount of [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) in its cargo hold. It has a mining range of 5500 studs and takes a minimum of ~333 seconds to fill up its hold. Huge amounts of [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) can be made if used in sync with a [Prepravca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prepravca) or another large trader.

## Appearance

The back of the **Rorqual** contains a small teleporter to the cockpit, which is just a small metal box. In front of the gray pilot's seat, you will see a white screen that has colorful buttons. There is also a fluorescent light above the screen, lighting up the room.

## Advantages

- Third-highest Cargo Hold of all obtainable Miners.
- Large [Ore]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) Hold.
- Earns a good amount of [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits).
- Tied with its VIP counterpart, the [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth) for 3rd highest health of all non-limited [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).

## Disadvantages

- Slow top speed and turn speed.
- It can take a while to get a full Ore Hold, usually taking 6--7 minutes to fill up.
- The slow pace and vulnerability of the **Rorqual**make it a prime target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- The positioning of the [Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) makes it so that you have to face directly toward the target [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) in order to mine it with maximum efficiency.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).

## Safety

- Make sure you always check if any enemies are coming every 30 seconds, either by looking around or using the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap).
- As with most [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), don't mine at war.
- Stay close to friendly combat ships when possible. They can help protect you from enemies.
- Try finding a [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) that has a lot of [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) around its [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and is not using as many [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
