The**_Woolly Mammoth_** is a reskin of the [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth).

## Description

The **Woolly Mammoth** was the most expensive [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event 2017</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017) ship with a price comparable to the [Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx). Though the ship is not visually different apart from always being brown, there are special features that set it apart from the original [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth).

## Appearance

The interior of the **Woolly Mammoth**is the same as the original [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth) model; a small room containing a ladder which leads up to another small room containing some control panels and the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Amazing versatility for a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Great mobility for a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Third highest health for a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), right behind the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca).
- A very fast [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) in terms of mining speed, making it the best refundable miner.
- Doesn't require [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass).
- Long range (5500 studs).
- Has a faster mining rate than the famous [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy).

## Disadvantages

- Very expensive, at a massively high build cost of **4.5 million credits** (mainly due to the Class B Permit cost of 4 million credits).
- Pirates would consider this as a trophy kill, since **Woolly Mammoths** are extremely rare and give off an insanely high bounty or bounty credits (albeit that comes from the Class B Permit), and the fact that it's destruction will most likely bounty wipe its pilot due to the massive cost.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).

## Strategy

- Use your warp to move around to [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) that are close to you.
- If you are looking to make money out of [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) as well, [Mine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) one type of [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) only. This way that Ore's cost is reduced by a lot, allowing you to sell it at a [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) for a massive profit.
- Use it in [VIP Servers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Servers) for maximum safety and amount of ores.
- **Never** mine during a war, if you lose it, it will take an insanely long time to even get it back.
- It's imperative that you watch the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) if mining on a private server or public server, as a couple of [Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) could end you.
- If you can, [Mine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) on a [Private Server]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Servers); this way, [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) can't disrupt your mining sessions.

## Trivia

- Frequently referred to as "Woolly".
- For almost 5 years, the name was misspelled as "Wooly" before finally being fixed in 2022.
- One of the only [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) obtained from an event, along with the [Festive Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp), [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp), [Patriotic Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Rorqual), [Maple Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Maple-Orca), [Freedom Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Galaxy) and [Snowy Advanced Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowy-Advanced-Miner).
- Its total health of 9,000 makes this one of the tougher, if not better [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) class ships to use.
- It has the same description as the [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth).
- Between the **Woolly Mammoth**, and its normal buildable [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) counterpart, the [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth) [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships); the **Woolly Mammoth**exceeds in health by 2,500 (2,750 for [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), 250 less for [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)), Top Speed by 150, Acceleration by 38, Turn Speed by 0.4, Cargo Hold by 150, Ore Hold by 1500.
- Most Galaxy players that own this ship hardly use it.
- The **Woolly Mammoth** used to have an ore hold of 6.5k even after RC made miners with 6.5k+ ore hold unrefundable. It is believed the devs thought the ship to be in no danger because few people owned it and hardly used it. However, after player [DylanTheVillain101](https://www.roblox.com/users/194352515/profile) was dock blocked by a group of [Prospectors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prospector) and [Wyrms]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm), Juice changed its ore hold from 6.5k to 5k and in turn buffed its speed, acceleration, turn speed, and health to compensate.
- Ore hold was later buffed from 5k to 6.5k and kept its buffs from earlier.
- It is argued as to whether or not the **Woolly Mammoth** is actually better than the [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy), although **Woolly Mammoth** has some advantages that could make it better.
- Used to be one of the rarest ships in the game of all time, with less than 15 people owning a **Woolly Mammoth** at one point.
