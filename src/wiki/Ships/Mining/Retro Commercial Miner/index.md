The **_Retro Commercial Miner_** is a Retro Model of the [Commercial Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Commercial-Miner).

## Description

The **Retro Commercial Miner** is a limited [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) ship with very little interior and a medium ore hold, designed to mine multiple [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) at once with great efficiency. It is a large jump in price from the normal [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) like the [M Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}M-Class). It takes a minimum of approximately 66 seconds to fill up its Ore Hold.

## Appearance

The **Retro Commercial Miner** has almost no interior. There is just a large glass cockpit with one seat, no detail, and a floor with a metallic texture. The [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) docks with the cockpit facing the terminal.

## Advantages

- 5 [Retro Medium Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) provide a mining rate faster than that of the [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca).
- Decent amount of health.
- Large Ore Hold.
- Can mine multiple [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) at once.
- High speed for its size.
- High survivability because of its speed and decent amount of health.

## Disadvantages

- Relatively expensive.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Fairly large for its class and easy to hit.
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) may declare [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) in order to destroy a more expensive and limited [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Due to the model and turret placement, some may find it awkward with the angles you may need to use to mine with all turrets at once.

## Strategy

- Check the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) every 30 seconds for pirates or other foes.
- Try to mine near your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) to decrease the chance of your ship being shot down.
- Never mine in a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Mine in a Private Server if you have access to one.

## Version History

- Added in version .73a3 as part of the 2021 Retro Ship Event.
- Ore Hold buffed from 2500 to 3250, Turn Speed nerfed from 0.8 to 0.55, Acceleration buffed from 10 to 40 after the Retro Event ended.

## Trivia

- This ship can mine broadside. Most of the [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are on the left side of the ship once you sit down.
