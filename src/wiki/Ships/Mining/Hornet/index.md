The **_Hornet_** is a medium-small sized **[Miner-class ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)**.

## Description

The **Hornet** is a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)-class ship which possesses three [Tiny Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). Its main body is made up of a large tubular section with [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on one end and a spherical cockpit with a geometric design on the other.

## Appearance

The interior is simple. Upon entry of the tiny yellow control room, there is a seat and 3 screens that operate the [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Advantages

- Fairly affordable.
- It Is the [Harvester]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvester)'s equal in mining speed, but is better in other stats.
- Fairly decent speed for a [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Has a large ore hold of 3,500, which is 3,000 larger than Tango's ore hold.

## Disadvantages

- An easy target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Small range with the Tiny Mining Lasers at 4,000 studs.
- Has no cargo hold.

## Strategy

- Should only be used during peaceful times.
- Should be used close to a Base/[Planet]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) with defensive [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Check your [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) constantly to avoid enemies and [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens).
- Never mine during [Wars]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Retreat to base if [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) is declared.

## Trivia

- One of the newer [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) to be added to the game.
- If used by a player with a level 1 [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse), it is immune to all damage. (Unconfirmed, as unobtainable with a level 1 [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse))
- The **Hornet** was proposed a long time ago with one [Medium Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) but was finally added in .61g with three [Small Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) instead.
- The explosion radius has been reduced to 0 multiple times due to a Roblox glitch.
- Earns enough credits to pay for itself in approximately 1-2 trips.
- Three times better than the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) in every way except for speed.
- There was noticeable part overlap in the original model, most notably in the cockpit, creating a "glitchy" effect when looked at.
- There's an image of Hornet from Hollow Knight on one of the screens.
- When it was first released, the explosion was so powerful that it was able to 1 shot certain battleships.
- Previously in [Galaxy Arcade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Arcade), it was referred as the obama-sphere as some joke to bait people that it is the best ship in the game.
- Looks like alien salt shaker.
