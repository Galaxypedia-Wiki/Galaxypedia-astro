The **_Retro Advanced Miner_** is a **[limited-edition]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** version of the [Advanced Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Miner) that features its original model and loadout.

## Description

The **Retro Advanced Miner** is a limited version of the Advanced Miner that uses the first model of the [Advanced Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Miner).

## Interior

The interior of the ship is a large room which leads to a ladder. This ladder will lead you to the pilot seat, in a small cabin. The cabin's walls are slightly misaligned.

## Advantages

- Mines Quickly with its 4 [Retro Mining lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

<!-- -->

- 5500 Ore hold can earn around 8k Credits each dump.
- At 30% [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty) you can dump for 15k Credits.

## Disadvantages

- It's low health make it easy for [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) to kill if wandering outside of base range.
- Part of a previous event and once it is lost its gone for good!
- Requires a pointed-down/pointed-up angle to successfully have all mining turrets active.

## Strategy

- Use it in servers where there are no wars and in private servers, as it is a limited event ship.
- Due to its small minimap icon, when mining at war (which is highly not suggested), you can hide your miner from the minimap by moving close to docked Capital Ships at the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- Your fast mining speed will do quick ore clean up in a private server where there is a ton of ores.
- When mining if an alien targets you quickly warp away, aliens can kill you before you fill up your ore hold.
- If a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) warps to your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), **DO NOT DOCK.** Your low health will let it kill you before you even despawn, instead warp 18k away from the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
