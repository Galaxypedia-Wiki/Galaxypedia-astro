The **_Festive Wasp_** is a [Limited Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) version of the **[Miner-Class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)**ship [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp).

## Description

The **Festive Wasp** is a [Limited Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ship, a reskin of the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp).

The exterior is orange and the boosters in the back are grey. It is also decorated with festive lights.

You were only able to get this ship by asking a [Galaxy Admin]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff) for it on Christmas in the [Christmas Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017).

Instead of carrying a Small Mining Laser like the normal [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp), it carries a [Large Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Appearance

Like the Wasp, the **Festive Wasp** has no interior.

## Advantages

- Great mobility.
- Small, making it hard for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) to aim at it.
- Great Ore Hold for a small [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Great Cargo Hold for a small [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- High health for a ship its size.
- Nearly impossible to kill, due to the combination of high Speed and high health.
- Good [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) speed.

## Disadvantages

- You can only get it once due to the fact that an admin would only give it to you once on a specific day.
- Gives high [Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty), which means [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating)/[Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty) Hunters will target you quite often if you use it.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Your **Festive Wasp** can fling you randomly in a certain direction if you're moving around while mining because of the massive mining turret.

## Strategy

- <s>Show this ship off while mining. Your friends will wish they had a **Festive Wasp**.</s>
- Treat this ship like a trophy, don't sell it or use it, ONLY use it if you are sure there is no [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) around you and there are no factions which had declared war on you.
- If you decided to use this ship, if a faction had declared war on you or an alien attacks you, quickly Dock at the nearest [starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}starbase) and despawn your [ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships), ASAP.

## Version History

- Added in update .60a
- Received a buff in update .60d that buffed Top Speed from 175 to 300.
- Received a second buff in update .60d that fixed model issues and made the ship invisible on the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap).
- Received another buff in update .60d that upgraded the ship's [Small Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to a [Medium Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Received 2 buffs in update .62a? that replaced the ship's [Medium Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) with a [Large Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and increased Ore Hold by 250.

## Trivia

- Galaxy Admins would give you this along with the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Coal Wasp</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp) on Christmas Day during the <span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event of 2021</span>.
- Only Galaxy Admins would give you this, and they'll only give it to you once.
- Galaxy Admins would give you this along with the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Coal Wasp</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp) on Christmas Day during the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event 2017</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017).
- If you were able to sell this ship (and get it back, which would be a Christmas miracle), you would get about 77,566 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits), which would be enough for a lot of ships. (Don't attempt this, as it will result in failure)
- This ship is a good backup [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) because of its [Large Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- One of the limited event ships available for one day, including the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Coal Wasp</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp), [2018 Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}2018-Ship) [surprise Raffle Ship on Discord], and the [United States of Razor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-States-of-Razor).
- The [Large Mining Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) is very disproportionate to the ship itself, as the laser is larger than the whole ship.
