{{< shipInfobox >}}

The**_Snowy Advanced Miner_**is a [**Miner**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) with 8 small [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It was the first Miner to be armed, sporting a single Light Laser Turret, but that has since been removed.

## Description

The **Snowy Advanced Miner** is a re-design of the [Advanced Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Miner), made for the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018). It features 8 [Small Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) arranged on prongs protruding out from both sides of the ship.

## Interior

The pilot seat is housed inside of a spherical glass pane topped with a Santa hat.

## Advantages

- Super fast and maneuverable.
- Mines faster than the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual).
- Decent ore hold.

## Disadvantages

- Expensive; required 10 [Snowflakes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowflake).
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) and [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) often target [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- It is hard to get all [Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to fire at a single chunk of [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), due to the ship moving in an odd way when compared to the Advanced Miner.
- Once you lose it, you cannot get it back unless refunded.
- It will be targeted by Pirates because of its rarity.

## Strategy

- Don't mine in [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Avoid factions that are vulnerable to War.
- If possible, mine in a [VIP Server]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Servers) to avoid Pirates. However, Aliens can still spawn.
- Try to check your map every 20 seconds for Aliens and other enemies.

## Version History

- Light Laser removed in version .65b.
- Ore Hold increased from 1800 to 4500 later in version .65b.
- Shields and Hull increased from 1,500/1,750 to 2,000/2,000 in version .75a10.
- Removed in version .75a37

## Trivia

- Between the **Snowy Advanced Miner**, and its "normal" counterpart, the [Advanced Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Miner); the **Snowy Advanced Miner** comes ahead in health by 1,800 (1,000 [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 800 [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)), Max Speed by 25, Turn Speed by 0.2, Cargo Hold by 80, Ore Hold by 3500, and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) with 4 more [Small Mining Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- It is one of the ships alongside the [Blizzard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blizzard) [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) to use the "Of course it has low health, it's made of snow!" joke.
- This was the first limited remodel of the Advanced Miner.
- <s>Of course it has low health, it's made of snow!</s>
