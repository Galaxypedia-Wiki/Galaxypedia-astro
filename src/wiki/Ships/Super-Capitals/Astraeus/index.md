The **Astraeus** is a powerful and long range [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) with one of the highest [Alpha Damage]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) in the game.

## Description

The **Astraeus** is a [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) made for [Diving]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) ships and [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) with its massive [alpha damage]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang). The owner of the ship MUST bring a fleet with them, with the biggest reason being that the **Astraeus**being almost unable to hit other ships with a crippling accuracy stat: especially [Destroyers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) and [Cruisers.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)

The Astraeus has a [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) "Targeting Supercomputer"

## Appearance

The **Astraeus** is one of the largest and widest ships in the game, dwarfing many [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers). The ship has similar detailing and design like other [Event Horizon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Event-Horizon) ships and has its logo on each sides of the ship. It has a bridge on the back of the ship, which is small compared to the overall size of the ship. Many of the turrets are one of the largest in-game, such as the Siege Cannons.

The Interior features a large room with the pilot seat elevated in a platform in the middle, and numerous computers around the walls.

## Advantages

- High alpha damage of 4000+ makes it potent at destroying less durable foes, such as [battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- High health, especially with [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields); which allows it to outlast many other ships in PvP without needing to retreat.
- Long range weapons allow it to outrange and snipe many targets, in addition to the Siege Cannons having a massive 8500 range.
- Okay ship for [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating), Capable of insta-killing many miners and freighters.
- Amazing for sieges. The turrets can snipe the base from far enough away to mitigate most of the damage and is capable of destroying most sub-capital to battleship defenders in one salvo if the turrets do not miss.

## Disadvantages

- Huge blind-spots behind and under the ship.
- Very slow turn speed.
- Long reload speed and non-ideal accuracy makes it impossible to hit small ships.
- Low DPS compared to other [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) and even strong Dreadnoughts.
- Vulnerable to shield breakers.
- One of the worst ships to attack small ships due to the very long turret reload time and potshot accuracy.
- Can be very easily overwhelmed by smaller, faster ships that focus on shield damage, such as a swarm of [Sabre Tooths.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sabre-Tooth)
- Despite the high alpha, the long reload time means ships with enough health can quickly charge their warp and escape if you have no support. The reload also makes it so if your turrets miss, the enemy has a relatively long time to attack before attempting to dodge the next volley. Skilled players can estimate when your turrets will fire and warp a short distance, or move into your blindspot.
- While the ship is capable of sieging with a great efficiency, it is sometimes (in some cases, significantly) worse at sieging than several other more specialized [siege ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}siege-ships); such as the [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon), [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion), [Kraken]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken), [Antares]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Antares), and [Frostpocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frostpocalypse). These ships - while _(mostly)_ lower in class - outperform the **Astraeus** at sieging because of the low damage output.

## Strategy

- As of the shield rework, the Astraeus can now tank an L5 base indefinitely if placed at recommended range.
- Stay 7500 studs away from the base you are sieging in order to hit all your weapons while taking minimal damage in return, as the Heavy LR Lasers and Super Lasers have 7500 range.
- Predict where the warp path of enemies' are and stand in their warp path to volley them while they are mid-warp. Astraeus's turrets are effective against warping ships due to their long range and the fact that warping ships have 0 Speed in turret calculations.
- Never get your Astraeus hulled, as it has low hull health, and you will be focused.
- The Astraeus is great for defending against sieges, and the alpha damage can destroy sieging ships in 1-3 vollies usually. Beware of large [carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) that are capable of withstanding your punishment for long enough to significantly damage you with an AI [fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) swarm. If they are supported by a fleet, they are capable of destroying your ship.
- **Do not fire your weapons unless you have a clear shot at the target and your speed relative to the target is as low as possible.**
- Similar to the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement), prioritize performing hit-and-run tactics. Prolonged ship-to-ship combat is not ideal for this ship, as it lacks the damage output needed for sustained close range brawls against other strong [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), multiple [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), or a Super Capital with high damage output; such as the [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion), [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia), or [Oblivion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Oblivion).
- Due to the terrible maneuverability, make sure to be under your target.
- Pirating with the Astraeus is very difficult, owing to the slow-moving nature and awareness other players have to Supercapitals.
