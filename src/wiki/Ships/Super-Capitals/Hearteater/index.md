_This article describes the NPC vessel. To see the player ship counterpart, see [Widowmaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Widowmaker)._ The **Hearteater** is a Pirate AI [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) (formerly a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)) released on February 14th, 2022; during the Valentine's Day 2022 Event.

## Description

The **Hearteater** is a Pirate-affiliated AI ship that ruthlessly shreds both the [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) of any ship if not attacked with care, due to its armament having very high damage output for a Battleship.

## Strategy

- Given that this ship will significantly damage most ships that try to attack it (and will almost certainly destroy them if in swarms), try to fight them one at a time with a strong [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)(with [AI Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI-Fighters)), or [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships). Beware the fact that these ships are capable of calling all other Pirates present on the map.
- **Do not attempt to take out the _Hearteaters_ if there is three or more of them with a ship.** This is because a swarm of them are very dangerous, unless you know what you're doing and fielding a powerful ship with high alpha damage like the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus) or [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement). Instead, deploy a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)(preferably one with many fighters) and use the [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to destroy the them.
- If fighting one of these head-on by itself, ensure that you get close enough to force it to turn away and not be able to shoot its spinals at you.

## Loot

For its power, the ship drops a measly loot of [3 Plasma Batteries]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Materials); on top of no Combat Rewards due to the ship having no value.

## Version History

- Heartifact Accelerator turrets nerfed: loses two barrels, resulting in a reload rate reduction in version .75a5.

- Ship class upgraded from Battleship to Super Capital, and stats changed in an unknown version:
  - Health changed from 2,300 [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 4,500 [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) to 29,000 Shield and 29,000 Hull.
  - Top speed increased from 120 to 320, and Acceleration increased from 20 to 50.
  - Cargo Hold increased from 1 to 2500, and Explosion Radius value increased from 600 to 1244.
  - Armament changed:
    - 4 Heartifact AcceleratorL and 4 Heavy Heartifact Accelerator [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) changed to 2 Siege Cannons, 4 Heavy Heartifact Lances, and 2 Heavy Heartifact Accelerators.
    - 6 Large Cannon spinals changed to 12 Huge Phasers and 12 Huge Cannons.

## Trivia

- The first person to lose their ship to a **Hearteater** was BADZAMAN with his [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco).
- Many players have lost large and expensive [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) to this foe. This is certainly not an enemy to underestimate.
