The **Oblivion** is a powerful [**Super Capital Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships), and is a jack of all trades, but a master of none.

## Summary

The **Oblivion** is a well balanced, all-rounder [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships). It is equipped with unique, rapid fire turret armament which has good accuracy, as well as cannon spinals for good, balanced damage output. It is best used as a versatile flagship for your team's fleet within ship-to-ship combat.

Additionally, the **Oblivion** is equipped with a unique "Blink Drive" [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules), which allows teleports a short distance towards a desired direction instantly.

## Appearance

The **Oblivion** has a large profile, with the long length being attributed to two long "prongs" that extend from the mid-section of the ship; with the rear-section being larger in volume, housing all the engines and most of the orbital turret mounts. The detailing is of large variety, with the name of the ship in black on both the top and bottom of the front of the ship; and having a mostly gray color with some orange, green, pink, and minor team-color detailing mixed in. There is four "mo-hawk"-like protrusions on the mid/rear section of the ship, two of them being of a pink neon color which are on the top and bottom of the center of the ship; and the other two being of orange neon color located on the bottom of the rear section of the ship, at mirrored angles. The interior is a small circular room containing three pink-ish screens, a trash can and the pilot's seat. There is a secret teleporter approximately to the right of the center screen that leads to a secret shrine dedicated to Elon Musk. The center screen reads out: _<span style="color:#5500FF">"Oblivion systems: ONLINE"</span>_. The right screen is an animated screen, which is a constant scroll animation of a script in the Roblox Studio script editor. The left screen shows a silhouette of the ship itself. The trash can contains a picture of the [Harvester]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvester), a currently retired ship.

## Characteristics

The **Oblivion** has decent, well balanced durability, with a slight bias towards [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health. It comes equipped with a rapid fire [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) armament which makes up the bulk of its damage output, while also having high accuracy (however, for their size and type, the turrets have somewhat short range). The [cannon spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry#Cannons) armament serve as a compliment to the turrets and help balance the overall firepower of the ship, allowing for decent, balanced firepower for a standard super capital ship. However, it lacks the ability to hit hard with a single salvo from all of its weaponry, due to the low damage of its turret armament. Its agility and maneuverability are decent, allowing effective engagement of other [capital ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) and most [battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers). However, it is still vulnerable to swarms of smaller, highly agile ships, similar to most other super capital ships; given the near complete lack of firepower with firing angles below the ship (this issue can be mitigated somewhat via use of the ship's module). The "Blink Drive" module, while potentially advantageous in ship-to-ship combat, is practically useless for any sort of long-distance travel due to the short range (2,000 studs). Overall, this is one of the most versatile super capital ships in the game.

Key Characteristics:

- Decent durability that is well balanced.
- Decent, well balanced damage output with turret and spinal armament.
- Rapid fire turrets have very good overall accuracy, allowing the ship to effectively engage small and agile ships.
- Decent agility and maneuverability.
- Somewhat short range on the turrets, given their size and type (5,250 studs).
- Poor turret firing angles below the ship.
- Short range of the "Blink Drive" module greatly limits its utility outside of direct confrontations with other ships.
- Large top and bottom profile, making the ship an easy target for [torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry#Torpedoes) (assuming the module isn't used to mitigate such a threat).
- High overall versatility, especially for a [super capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).

## Strategy

- Best used in a fleet as a versatile flagship, if one is planning to carry out multiple types of fleet strategies/tactics.
- Try not to use the [Blink Drive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) needlessly, as an experienced enemy pilot using an agile ship can capitalize on its cooldown (even though its not very long) to safely chip away at your health from your blind spots.
- Avoid large swarms of small, agile ships; your turrets aren't accurate enough to reliably hit and destroy them fast enough to avoid being overwhelmed. Additionally, your size and maneuverability makes it easy for swarms to stay in your blind-spots. Bring support ships if possible, to protect yourself.
  - However, it is possible to fight off smaller swarms on your own, provided you are using the ship's module to constantly teleport and keep your enemies out of your blind spots as much as possible. Although, you have to be careful that you do not do so while isolated for too long, or you will likely become the target of a heavy assault by a fleet of many enemy ships.
- Avoid fighting ships like the [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus) which are able to use their long range and high alpha damage against you without support. This ship is capable of a lot, but do not forget that its range is rather limited by comparison to [siege ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}siege-ships).

## Trivia

- The second super capital ship to have [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- The ship contains a hidden room nicknamed by the galaxy player base the "Church of Musk". The teleporter for this secret area (while slightly buggy) can be found near the left screen. However, the room is currently broken and if a player teleports into it they become stuck and cannot move. Most of the time they are able to rotate to use the teleporter again but occasionally they get stuck and have to reset.
- The ship has alien text to the left and right of the hull-mounted turrets respectively, which translates to "KNEALL". Why this is here is completely unknown, however.
