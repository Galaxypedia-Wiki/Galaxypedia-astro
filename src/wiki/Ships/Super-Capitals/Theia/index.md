The **_Theia_**is an extremely powerful Glass Cannon PVP-oriented [**Super Capital Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships)

## Description

The **Theia** is a PVP ship capable of dishing out enormous amounts of damage in a short time with its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

The Theia has a [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) "Spinal Array"

## Appearance

The Theia is an extremely long and slender [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) that has many defining features including its "Power Core" located visibly in the middle of the ship as a large blue orb and 2 engines accompanying it on the sides. Its long Spinal barrel in the front taking almost 1/3 of the length of the Ship. An extremely large single engine located at the back of the ship almost being as large as its spinal barrel. The overall appearance of this ship makes it look like a large gun with engines attached to it than a ship.

The Interior of the Theia is a rather small but detailed room. When you first enter, it has a stairs with two Computers beside that lead to the pilot's seat. Inside the pilot seat room, there is a large black screen with the logo of the [Event Horizon Shipyards]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Event-Horizon) on each end of it citing its Manufacturer. It has the same color scheme as other ships by [Event Horizon Shipyards]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Event-Horizon) such as the [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris).

## Advantages

- Fast turn speed for a [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships), and even faster than many [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Doesn't have many blind spots.
- Nearly triple the spinal DPS of the [Oblivion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Oblivion), with almost equal [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) DPS.
- [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) and [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) damage output are insane, both making up almost each half of the **Theia's** DPS.
- Extremely high DPS. The **Theia** is the highest DPS ship in Galaxy, with the exception of the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) having higher DPS at 5% or more loyalty.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are packed close together, making them easier to land.
- Decent speed and acceleration allows it to outpace many [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Disadvantages

- **Lowest total health** out of all [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships), at 55,000 HP.
- Can be difficult to use alone due to the low health for a Super Capital.
- Difficult to obtain or re-obtain due to extremely expensive cost of [SC permits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permits).
- A little over half of its DPS relies on Spinal aiming, which can be difficult because of the low maneuverability.
- Rather inaccurate turrets are (mostly) incapable of hitting anything smaller than a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Limited effective range with the turrets and low HP for a Super Capital ends up making this ship unsuitable for sieging.

## Strategy

- Use the ship while solo only if you are confident that you won't die. Always have a fleet with you.
- Make sure to not attack Fleets or [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) without a fleet of your own.
- Use the extremely high firepower of this ship to focus and destroy capital ships like Battleships or Dreadnoughts in ridiculous speeds.
- Pay attention and check the Minimap often to make sure you're not about to be ambushed. Your low health and status as a Super Capital Ship means you must always avoid damage as much as possible.
- It is not a good idea to siege with this ship because of its low health and limited range.
- When fighting, stay pointed exactly in line with other Super Capital Ships in fights so that all your weapons have a line of sight.
- Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship. The Theia can do tremendous amounts of damage, but being targeted greatly increases your chances of being destroyed.
- Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships).
- Know when to warp away, judging by the DPS of the other ships targeting you, or when your shield drops to dangerous levels.
