The **_Subjugator_** is the [**Super Capital Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) with the highest total health, it's capable of withstanding monstrous amounts of damage, but at the lack of damage compared to ships of it's class.

## Description

The **Subjugator** is an incredibly sturdy [**Super Capital Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships), able to take huge amounts of damage for extended periods of time while providing fire support to its allies.

This ship excels at being a flagship in a fleet due to its extreme durability, and is versatile at pressuring the enemy during sieges or fleet battles.

The Subjugator has a [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) "Shield Bulwark"

## Appearance

The **Subjugator** is one of the largest ships in the game. It has a smooth and militaristic design that is similar to the [Nisos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nisos), with multiple large platings all around the ship. It has a long body with [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) lined along the top and bottom, along with multiple [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth) flags located throughout the ship. Its most iconic feature are the two [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide) located on each side of the ship, connected to the ship by a unique particle effect.

The Interior is a round room with 3 screens, one being a hexagonal display, the other being the UNE Flag, and the other having a text that reads: <span style="color:#76381f"><span style="font-size:15pt">**U. N. E.**</span> _SUBJUGATOR Class Warship_</span> and a control seat that is similar to the [Oblivion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Oblivion) and [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner).

## Advantages

- Has the highest HP out of any normally obtainable ship in the game, with a monstrous 105000 HP (without its [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide)), allowing it to tank damage for long periods of time.
- [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide) have health each, and can regenerate after being destroyed like other [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Above average [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) accuracy.

## Disadvantages

- Huge, making it an easy target for [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) and heavier [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Can be easily swarmed by smaller ships due to having no Light or Medium Turrets.
- Lower Hull damage compared to Shield damage.
- Can only fire all Turrets at a single target with a broadside angle, making it easier to hit and run away from.
- The [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide) are weak to shield-breakers such as the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus).
- Below average damage output for a Super Capital-class ship, being the lowest out of all Super Capitals in the game.
- Enemy spinals have a chance to pass through the [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide).
- The [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide) can block the line of sight of the Subjugator's Turrets.

## Strategy

- Position your Subjugator well in order to make full use of the [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide), as they provide expendable health.
- Broadsiding is key for the Subjugator to be used against most targets due to its turret placement and the position of the ShieldSides.
- It is not recommended to travel alone in this ship due to its massive size, lack of protection from smaller ships, and subpar damage output.
  - Don't take high value risks, and don't overestimate your massive health, the ship can still be destroyed if swarmed by an experienced team or group of powerful ships.
- It is very hard to take out small ships with this, so use it for tanking in Sieges or tanking large ships head-on.
- Use this ship to tank bases while your teammates kill the enemy ships or siege the base. This is extremely useful at bases such as [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion), where the damage can kill battleships in one volley.

## Trivia

- The original model's interior included user Wiscyy's profile picture, commonly used in her builds as a signature.
- Closely resembles the [Invincible](https://wiki.star-conflict.com/index.php?title=Invincible) from the game Star Conflict.
- It is one of the largest ships in the game.
- Often considered "invincible" due to the large health pool, auxiliary shields, and resistance, which is ironic because the ship it is based on is called the [Invincible](https://wiki.star-conflict.com/index.php?title=Invincible).
- Has an AI variant; The [UNE Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}UNE-Subjugator), though the variant has no [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide) present on the ship.
