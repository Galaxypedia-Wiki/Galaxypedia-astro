The **Thubjugator** is a [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia) with the durability and auxiliary shields of the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator).

## Description

This ship is equivalent to or stronger than the [Prototype-class Super Capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes) in terms of firepower and durability, being effectively a [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia) and [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator) fused together. For the same reason, it is also a unique ship. It is obtained by contacting a Galaxy admin for this ship when you finish legitimately obtaining a total of 150 million Credits, which will then be taken from you in exchange for the ship when the transaction is complete.

## Appearance

The appearance is identical to that of the [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia), besides the [ShieldSides]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide) being present.

## Advantages

- Massive health pool and auxiliary shields allow you to soak **a lot** of damage.
- Extremely high firepower with the [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) allow you to crush just about every other capital ship there is within the game.
- Enemies may flee just from seeing the ship spawn.
- Currently can be obtained at any time, so long as you have the money for it and can contact an admin.

## Disadvantages

- The most expensive ship to date, at an outstanding cost of 150 <u>**_million_**</u> Credits. This ship will be an extremely high value target in any situation.
- Extremely high cost means losing the ship will make obtaining one again **very** difficult and time-consuming.
- Inaccurate turrets allow the ship to be easily swarmed by small, nimble ships.

## Strategy

- It is in your best interest to not trust anyone, given the rarity and expense of the ship.
- Always fly in fleets. A lone **Thubjugator** is prone to being targeted by many people at once.
- It may be a wise idea to instead treat this ship as a trophy ship if you do happen to own it, because of how valuable of a target it is.
- This ship can work in [sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging), but it does better in ship-to-ship combat; and more specifically, destroying other [capital ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships).
- If you must use this ship, **always** use it with caution.

## Trivia

- The first, and also currently the only ship to be a "fusion" of two ships, that being the [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia) and the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator).
- The cost of $150,000,000 is a record high cost for any obtainable item or ship in the history of Galaxy.
- Was originally intended for NOCHOZ, a player who was willing to spend <u>940,000</u> Robux (about **<u>$9,400</u>** USD) for it.
- Has crazy combat reward of 3 million when killed.
- Considered by some to be a "No-Lifer" achievement to obtain this ship, due to the amount of time needed to gain the required credits for it legitimately.

## Version History

- Added in an unknown version.
