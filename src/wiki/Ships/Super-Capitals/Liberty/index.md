The **_Liberty_** is an American-themed [**Super Capital**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) briefly released during the [2021 Fourth of July Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fourth-of-july-2021).

## Description

The **Liberty** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) Super Capital reskin based around the [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion). It was released for a very short time during the 2021 Fourth of July Event.

## Interior

The interior of the **Liberty** is based on a patriotic recolor of the Prototype X-1's interior.

## Advantages

- High, well-balanced health.
- Respectable shield damage

## Disadvantages

- Torpedoes shoot 90 degrees right
- Weak hull damage
- Poor lines of sight; can't hit all turrets facing forward OR broadside.

## Strategy

- Use this ship on stationary targets as the turret and spinal positioning is very delicate.
- This ship's limited availability and large size makes it a prime target; only use it in well-defended, controlled situations or to it show off.

## Version History

- "Moth-balled" in version .72f1, effectively rendering the ship unusable (for those who still have it, open a ticket in the Official Galaxy Discord to request a refund).

## Trivia

- This ship was a mistake, same with [Dominion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dominion)
