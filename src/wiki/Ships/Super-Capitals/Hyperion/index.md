{{< notices/superCapitalShip >}}

The **_Hyperion_** is one of the six **[Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships)** in the game. This enormous ship can easily stand up to other large ships.

## Description

Built from the ring world Hyperant, the home of the [Osiris Legion Shipyards]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris-Legion). With unparalleled long range potential, the **Hyperion** makes for a fantastic [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) ship. Featuring a heavy array of both [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), the enormous **Hyperion** can easily stand up to other large ships.

The Hyperion has a [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) "Commanding Presence"

## Appearance

The exterior features a great quantity of detailing in a similar fashion to ships such as the [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris). In the interior, a small teleporter pad teleports you into an orange decorated hallway. Moving forward you enter a small room with an orange glowing orb with the Osiris Legion Insignia. There are 2 paths to the control room which has 3 seats and decorated walls. The pilot's seat is in the middle and has an orange screen with the Osiris Legion insignia.

## Advantages

- Variety of both [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) give it massive damage output and range.
- [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) mount gives good line of sight to defend the ship from almost every angle.
- Very strong explosion value of 1500 (The same as Prototypes, an 87.5% larger nuke than Prometheus, coming in at a radius of 15,000 studs).
- High alpha damage with its [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) and turrets.
- Can obliterate hull from its overwhelming Hull DPS and alpha.
- Can siege bases from afar with its [huge torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) since it outranges [starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}starbase) turrets. Additionally, a large portion of its turrets can outrange a starbase's main heavy-hitting turrets (aside from railguns), further reducing risk.
- Effective at destroying large and sluggish ships due to the high damage output.
- Has a high cargo hold of making it able to loot wrecks.
- Ridiculous efficiency in sieges, due to the long range, massive damage, high health, and status as a Super Capital, which can scare off most enemies.

## Disadvantages

- Turrets suffer from very poor accuracy against moving targets, making it easy to miss a ship even the size of a [dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) from medium range if the target is moving (this also applies inversely; if the ship is moving too fast against a stationary target, the turrets are prone to missing from a distance). Combined with the available spinal weaponry, this ship is extremely prone to being easily swarmed by smaller, nimble ships.
- You have to point directly at targets to shoot all turrets.
- The Huge Torpedoes move at a snail's pace (300 studs/second), making it rather difficult to hit moving targets unless you're within very close range of them, or they are very large; on top of them making up a significant portion of the ship's damage output.
  - Additionally, the huge torpedoes have a very long reload time.
- Very expensive, being the 2nd most expensive super capital putting it behind the Lucifer (except for [prototypes]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes) as well as the [Thubjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Thubjugator)) and requiring an SC Build Permit.
- Somewhat sluggish maneuverability compared to some other super capital ships.
- Has a long hallway from the pilot's seat to the exit, increasing the time for you to de-spawn. Additionally, due to issues with the interior, the player can get stuck inside the body of ship, and the teleporter may break for certain players (usually not the pilot). Both of these are refundable if sufficient evidence is provided.

## Strategy

- Travel in fleets so you are defended from other fleets or swarms.
- Focus on larger targets at close range when you can to ensure that your weapons can land accurately.
- In a [Siege,]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) you can defend from large ships that attempt to break up the fleet. You can also outrange [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) with the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), and some of the turrets.
- Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.
- Even though this ship has a strong nuke, it is almost certainly not worth doing a suicide mission in this ship due to the expense.
- Pick your battles: Unless you know you have a fleet you can trust and that the enemy team has neither lots of competent and coordinated players or tricks up their sleeve, it is almost always better to use a cheaper alternative.
