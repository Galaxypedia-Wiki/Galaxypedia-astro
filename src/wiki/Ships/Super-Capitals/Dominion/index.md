The **_Dominion_** is a Canadian-themed [**Super Capital**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) briefly released during the [2021 Fourth of July Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fourth-of-july-2021).

## Description

The **Dominion** is a limited ship from the "Canada Day" component of the 4th July Event 2021. It was released for a very short time before being pulled offsale. It functions similarly to the [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia).

## Interior

The interior of the **Dominion** is a recolour of the Prototype X-1's interior featuring two screens by the pilot's seat with a maple leaf on them.

## Advantages

- High Shield DPS
- Fast turn speed

## Disadvantages

- Low health
- Somewhat lacking in Hull DPS
- Difficult to line up and hit all its turrets

## Strategy

- If using solo, it is best used against shield tanks such as the judgement. Try to bring a buddy in a ship with high hull dps in order to secure the kill

## Version History

- "Moth-balled" along with the Liberty in version .72f1, rendering the ship unusable. In the Official Galaxy Discord, you can refund for this ship if you own it(before it is removed).

## Trivia

- Shortest release of any deliberate ship release. (Was pulled off-sale within 10 minutes)
- asd1232468 accidentally sold a [Skeletal Ghostealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Skeletal-Ghostealis) to get this ship
- The first person, and only person to lose this was xps_15 to xXZombieKiller567Xx's [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion) when his account got hijacked.
- Currently not usable, broken and fails to load.
- ~It looks like a recolored Hyperion~
