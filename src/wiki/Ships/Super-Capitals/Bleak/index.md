The **Bleak** is a Pirate Boss.

## Description

The **Bleak** is a Pirate Boss that spawns during Pirate Raids. It is one of the strongest naturally spawning ships in the game, along with the [Eradicator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Eradicator).

## Appearance

The Bleak has similar design elements to that of the [Nautilus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nautilus) and the [Zillavik]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zillavik), with floating turrets and neon stripes around it. However, it is primarily red in color, and is much, _much_ larger than either of them.

## Behavior

- Spawns next to the main base of a team. If that base is not present, it spawns at a random base on that team.
- Usually targets the base it spawns next to, but will unpredictably target other ships.
- Turns very fast for it's size when it locks on to something.
- Doesn't do any nuke damage, despite the nuke radius being a whopping 1500.

## Strategy

- Do **NOT** attempt to 1v1 it. You will die a very painful death.
- It prioritizes targeting the base that it spawns next to, but can also lock on to ships, and once it does, it kills in seconds. Do not spawn anything expensive near it.
- Use Battleship-Class ships or under to avoid a large loss if you get targeted, but also to deal a lot of damage.
- Attack the bottom, as it has no armament there.

## Loot

- Unknown.

## Version History

- Added in the MEGA Update Part 1.

## Trivia

- Highest turret DPS (Damage Per Second) and health of any naturally spawning ship.
- Has an acceleration of 5, but has a top speed of 0.
- Does 0 damage upon explosion.
