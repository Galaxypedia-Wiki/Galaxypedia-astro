The **_Frostpocalypse_** is a powerful, high health [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) from the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).

## Description

The **Frostpocalypse** is a redesign of the [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse) [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). It was released on December 20th, 2018, when the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018) update came out.

## Appearance

The **Frostpocalypse** has an interior similar to the interior of the regular [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse)'s old model. The only difference being wooden seats, and 2 smaller screens on the side of the large screen of the pilot's seat reading: :Frost Levels: Frosty", and "Current List: Naughty".

## Advantages

- Great amount of health for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) along with 50% damage resistance.
- High [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) DPS.
- Insane alpha of over 4500 to both [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) rivals most [Super Capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).
- Has a large cargo hold for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Can be used to siege [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) from afar.

## Disadvantages

- Difficult to attack or defend itself against ships smaller or faster than it.
- Just like the [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse), the ship is weak to attacks directed towards its backside.
- Slower maneuverability than it's [regular counterpart]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse).
- Once you lose this ship, **YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK!**
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) (player) are more likely to target you because of the fact that the **Frostpocalypse** is extremely rare.

## Strategy

- PvP other large ships with your fleet and stay close to the front lines, enabling your team to attack from the sides or support from afar.

## Version History

- Added in .65b.
- The [Large Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) got nerfed and were replaced by [Medium Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in an unspecified version.
- [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) increased to from 6900 to 7200 and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) increased from 7000 to 7250 in an unknown version.
- Explosion Size 750 ----> 800 .75a12

## Trivia

- Added during the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).
- Most expensive Event Ship in the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).
- Even though it is the most expensive ship in the event, the [Frozen MRLS Launcher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frozen-MRLS-Launcher) still required more [Snowflakes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowflake).
- Between the **Frostpocalypse**, and its normal buildable counterpart, the [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse) [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts); the **Frostpocalypse** comes ahead in health by 2980 health (1180 [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 1800 [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)), Cargo Hold by 1660, and stronger [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). However, it falls short of 0.04 Turnspeed and 2 acceleration.
- [Specimen_1374](https://www.roblox.com/users/505347830/profile) was the first player to kill a **Frostpocalypse.**The **Frostpocalypse** killed belonged to [epictom11](https://www.roblox.com/users/37173813/profile).
- [Rocket_GotG](https://www.roblox.com/users/33641196/profile) was the first player to purchase the **Frostpocalypse** and also the first to make a video of it when **Frostpocalypse**had 6 [Crystal Heavy Rails]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) before nerf.
- It still retains the old [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse) model (apart from the festive alterations)
