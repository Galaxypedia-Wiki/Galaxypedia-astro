_This article describes an NPC boss ship. For the player ship with an identical appearance, see [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator)._

The **_Decimator_** is an **[AI]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Kneall]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations)** boss ship.

## Description

The **Decimator** is a large, powerful [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) ship that can be extremely dangerous if not handled carefully. Though it deals immense damage towards both shield and hull, it is generally better at damaging hull, as most of its weapons are railguns and contains 8 Huge Torpedoes with a 200-second interval, and 8 Large Cannons.

## Behavior

Decimator's AI is the same as most [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) Ships in the game.

**It spawns every 60 minutes.**

## Strategy

This ship's firepower leans more on hull damage, so use a shield-based ship such as the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement), or a tank such as the [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus).

**Avoid its front**, the Decimator's front make up the bulk of its damage at a whopping 400+ DPS.

The main and best way to deal with the Decimator is to get extremely near it _(<1500 Studs)_, to force it to turn around, losing most of its DPS. Most, if not all [BM]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) could take down the Decimator via this strategy without even getting hulled. The Decimator will call in reinforcements like [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher)'s so it's better to destroy other [Kneall]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations) ships before attacking the Decimator.

## Loot

The wreck of a **_Decimator_** contains 200 [Alien Parts]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Part), 35k in Combat Rewards and 8 Plasma Batteries.
