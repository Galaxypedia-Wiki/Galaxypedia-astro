## Summary

The **Retro Ridgebreaker** is a **[limited-edition]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** of the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker) that features its original model and armament. Compared to its counterpart, it features extensive armament upgrades, slightly improved agility, and greatly improved durability. The ship has extremely high kinetic firepower as a result (more so than the vast majority of existing [super capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) and the highest of all [dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)), allowing it to quickly shred the [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health of unshielded [capital ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), and destroy them. It is best used in assisting organized fleet assaults for targeting high-value, difficult to destroy capital ships, and [sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) weakened and/or unshielded bases.

## Appearance

The ship's appearance bears a strong resemblance to the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker), though with an obvious, "outdated"/classic style. It has little in the way of fine details on its hull, though the bow features a signature mostly decorative structure with triple prongs extending frontally, as well as two "wings" extending out to the side, near the spinal cannon barrels. The interior consists of a simple, empty room with a chair on an elevated platform, and a control panel at the front with numerous buttons.

## Characteristics

The **Retro Ridgebreaker** possesses an exclusive, heavy armament of kinetic weaponry, allowing it to have extremely high kinetic firepower which is capable of easily destroying what would otherwise be capital ships that just barely manage to escape in one piece from combat, as well as ships which are heavily reliant on [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health. However, it is easily swarmed by smaller, agile ships due to its large blind spots, relatively poor turret tracking accuracy, and poor maneuverability. While it is smaller than its normal counterpart, it still is a fairly large ship, making an easy target for [torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) when combined with the poor mobility; even though torpedoes are normally difficult to hit most ships with due to their poor speed.

Key Characteristics:

- Significantly improved overall durability compared to its normal counterpart.
- Extremely high kinetic firepower.
- Good overall range, long range when exclusively using turret armament.
- Poor maneuverability.
- Relatively poor [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) tracking accuracy, making it difficult to effectively damage fast moving targets.
- Large bottom and rear blind spots.

## Strategy

- Best used as a part of organized fleet assaults against difficult to destroy, high-value [capital ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), as well as [sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging).
- Avoid isolating yourself, as this ship is a high-value target and can easily be swarmed.
