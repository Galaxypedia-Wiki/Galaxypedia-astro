The **_Antares_** is a **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)** that was part of the second stage of the [2019 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2019) and was re-introduced in the [<span style="color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;">Christmas Event 2022</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2022).

## Description

The **_Antares_** is a long range and hard hitting [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), just like its little sister [Aludra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aludra).

It excels at obliterating hulled ships with its massive hull-based firepower.

## Appearance

The **Antares** is long but thin [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that has a shape that resembles a submarine, with detailing and design extremely similar to its little sister [Aludra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aludra), with various plating, pipes, and even grills detailed on the ship. On the back has its prominent "Orb" which is its most recognizable feature.

The Interior of the **Antares** is a nicely detailed small room with walls covered in ice and a snowflake symbol. On the middle of the room can be found the pilot seat which is facing a screen.

## Advantages

- Very high health for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Extremely long range, making it suitable for [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies).
- Insane hull damage output, at a Hull DPS of 412, making **Antares** an amazing diving ship.
- Slim frame when pointing towards targets making it harder to hit.
- High alpha makes it great for diving ships.

## Disadvantages

- Slow maneuverability.
- Large blind-spot at the back of the ship, where there is little to no firepower.
- Struggles engaging against small ships.
- Little to no shield-based weapons means it will do little to no damage against shields.

## Strategy

- Prioritize hulled targets, or ships with hull-based health such as the [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon).
- Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.
- During a siege, stay out of base range and shoot your [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Learn how far ahead of your targets you need to fire your torpedoes to hit them, and adjust based on their speed. Torpedoes do a lot of damage and aiming them properly can help you destroy ships much faster.
- Use your high range to your advantage in Sieges.
- It is very hard to take out small ships with this so bring [AA]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) support with you.
- Bring a shield shredder like the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) or [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) with you to quickly cripple or destroy enemy capital ships.

## Version History

- Buffed in version .75a5. 1 medium flak and 1 dual cannon were swapped out for 2 Heavy Icy Artillery Cannons. 2 heavy point defense lasers swapped out for 2 Super LR lasers. Torpedo interval reduced to 0.1. Speed buffed to 60 and acceleration buffed to 15. Turn speed was buffed to 0.15. Hull health increased from 6000 to 6500.

- Re-released during the [<span style="color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;">Christmas Event 2022</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2022) in version 75a37.

## Trivia

- Has a little sister; The [Aludra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aludra).
- Most of its turrets are what seems to be Myriad's, but colored differently.
- One of the few ships to have [Huge Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- In its description it says that the Ice Monster raised the ship from ice sheets, while with every other [2019 Christmas]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}christmas-event-2019) ship has been taken over by the Ice _(except for the [Snowfall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowfall))_.
- The first player to lose an **Antares** was Krusadr007, to an [Atlas]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Atlas).
- Despite its name, it is not related to the [Antares Comet]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Antares-Comet) _(Part of the [Christmas 2020]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}christmas-event-2020) event)_, which was known for crashing into [Aqueous II]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous-II), in addition to offering the [Crystocrene]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Crystocrene) for 75 snowflakes and 150k credits.
