The **_Liberator_** is a **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)** added during the [Fourth of July Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-Event-2020).

## Description

The **Liberator** is a unique Dreadnought with its own Patriotic [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It stands out among its class as an extremely maneuverable ship with a slim design, though it comes at the cost of slightly mediocre health when taking into account its price. It has a long, tapered body with a "patriotic" red, white, and blue color scheme. The ship can be entered through a teleporter-door on one side, which also means it docks "sideways." This ship was the only unique (non-reskin) ship added during the [Fourth of July Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-Event-2020).

## Appearance

The interior of the **Liberator** is very simple: a metallic, blue box with the American flag,Â a seat, and a small teleporter pad.

## Advantages

- High maneuverability.
- Armed with unique [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) that have high [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) have good [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Very fast, with an impressive top speed of 125.
- Its slim design enhances its evasive abilities.

## Disadvantages

- Was very expensive when it was onsale, requiring a level 28 [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse).
- Somewhat fragile for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) of its cost.
- Requires [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aiming in order to deal effective [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Very difficult to aim all [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) and spinals at the same time.
- Despite being very mobile, its vulnerable underside leaves it prone to swarms.

## Strategy

- Use this ship's extreme maneuverability to strafe and drift around enemy ships like you would in a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Avoid using this ship in dangerous situations, as it can't be rebuilt after the event ends.
- Although this ship has Light Turrets, they are best used against larger ships rather than smaller ones.
- Due to the lack of shield damage outside of spinals, this ship somewhat struggles at destroying smaller vessels with decent shields.

## Version History

- [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) reduced to 2200 in version .68b, which caused a price drop.
- [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) increased from 5800 to 6500, [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) increased from 3000 to 4000, [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement changed and teleporter position changed in version .68b.
- Hull increased from 4000 to 6500 and 2 [Patriotic Mass Drivers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) added in version .69e.
- Speed decreased from 130 to 100 in an unknown version.
- Explosion Size 160 ----> 820 .75a12

## Trivia

- DrWhoInTARDIS was the first to lose this to Shadiris's [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer).
- Used to break all [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) projectiles and sound effects.
- Used to have 130 speed, which was the highest of any [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) at the time.
