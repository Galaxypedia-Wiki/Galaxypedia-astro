The **_Slipstream_** is a fast and maneuverable [Slarfie]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slarfie) [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with a focus on speed and turret firepower.

## Description

What the **Slipstream** lacks in shield integrity it makes up for with sheer [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) strength. Its speed of '}} makes it faster than all other [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) in the game excluding the [SR-71]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}SR-71). This ship's speed and decent firepower makes it great for being a multipurpose ship. All these combined, the Slipstream can be used as a multi-role ship like other [Advanced Ships.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships)

## Appearance

The Slipstream is the tallest ship in the game, and also one of the thinnest capital ships. It features a large fin on top of the ship, as well as an even larger one on the bottom, and has many orbital turrets around the ship. The ship sports a unique color palette with orange-yellow and blue detailing around the ship. In the middle, there can be text in Alien Language that says <span style="color:#FFAE42">"Peace For All"</span>.

The Interior is pretty simple, having a cockpit and two terminals at the right and left side of the pilot's seat and a hologram in front of the seat. There are also a few decorative elements. ![<span style="color:#FFAE42">"*Peace For
all*"</span>|none](Peaceforall.png ""Peace For all"|none")

## Advantages

- The highest turret DPS of any [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) at '}}, close to [Deity]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Deity)'s DPS of .
- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) have good placement and a decent line of sight and can shoot behind the ship.
- One of the fastest [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) at 120 max speed, faster than most [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and even some [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- High [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health, making it strong against shield-breakers.
- Versatile [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) to dive ships with, having high firepower and speed to chase its target.
- High turn speed for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Very versatile for a Dreadnought, It can chase hulled ships, being a support in sieging [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), and fighting other Capital Ships.
- Can outmaneuver most Dreadnoughts, making it useful in PvP as well.

## Disadvantages

- Weak [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) compared to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull), making it susceptible to hull-breakers like the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker).
- Tall build makes it easier for [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to land a hit on the ship vertically. However, this can be fixed by turning the ship sideways.
- Difficult for all [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to fire at once unless pointing directly in front of the target.
- Low accuracy for most of its weapons.
- Has difficulty docking if other large [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) are under it.
- [Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) ship on a limited rotation, meaning it will be expensive and cannot be re-obtained until it is back in rotation.

## Strategy

- Use the excellent [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) Placement and mobility to fight other [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- If you line up correctly with an enemy ship chasing you, the chances to hit it at 100% speed will Increase.
- Use this to chase down [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) and miners to abuse its powerful speed and damage.
- You can [drift]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) at full speed by turning your ship 90 Degrees at full speed then pressing Z or C, depending on your drifting direction.
- When going against [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) focused ships, exploit their requirement to travel and keep a long distance to dodge the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) with its speed, while picking away at the enemy's health.
- Avoid large groups of skilled [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), as just 3 [Aeaphiels]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aeaphiel) can heavily damage or even destroy you.
- Always keep an eye on your health, this ship is extremely expensive, and you might not afford losing it.
- Use the excellent maneuverability to dodge the fire of stronger PvP ships that require their spinals to deal damage.
- Try not to use it as a flagship in sieges, it can't tank for very long and has mostly low range turrets. Instead use it to fight off defensive enemy ships or to support heavy sieging ships.
- Easily pirate defenseless miners and freighters with the speed and turret firepower.
- 2-3 of these, much like the triple [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris), can easily cut down dreadnoughts and fight against most [Super Capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships). Don't be afraid to take on lone dreadnoughts, though stay vigilant as lone dreadnoughts may be a bait.
