The **_Aberrant_** is a [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that is part of the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019).

## Description

The **Aberrant** is a Limited [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) featuring in the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019), It is the first ship ever to have [Bio Accelerator Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), which makes this ship unique. It is also the cheapest Dreadnought of the Event.

## Interior

The interior consists of a small corridor with a teleporter you enter in, then at the end is a seat with a head piece, this seat controls the ship. The whole interior is made with green neon and black.

## Advantages

- High damage to both [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull), this being thanks to its 10 [Large Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry), 3 Heavy Bio-Accelerators and 3 Bio-Accelerators.
- High shield health and decent hull health.
- Decent mobility for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Disadvantages

- Shield damage depends almost entirely on the Phasers.
- Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.
- Hard to concentrate all Turrets on the same target due to their placement.
- Has an unusually large hitbox, making it easier to hit with Turrets and Spinals.

## Strategy

- Use the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to shred the [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) of a ship, then let the Bio-Accelerator [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) do the rest of [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- Avoid smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), as your Turrets are not accurate enough to hit them.
- Use sparingly, as it is costly and will become unobtainable after the event.
