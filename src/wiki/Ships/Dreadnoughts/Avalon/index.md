The **_Avalon_** is a light, [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-focused [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Description

The **Avalon** is a small but powerful [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that can fire a volley of [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). Its spinals are incredibly deadly if they connect, however they can be hard to hit against faster and/or smaller targets. The **Avalon's**total health is very low for its class and it has subpar maneuverability, making it easy to overwhelm this ship with another [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) or even a strong [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) such as the [Nautilus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nautilus).

It is one of the most popular choices for a siege ship, as its spinals provide an extremely long range and a high damage output. It can also somewhat function as a glass cannon support in PVP, however its low health for its class and poor maneuverability severely limits its potential in ship combat. This Dreadnought is also surprisingly effective at warding off small ships thanks to its multiple [Heavy Point Defence Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Heavy Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Appearance

The interior is small but detailed. The player enters through a teleporter at the rear of the ship into a square room inside the ship with a control seat in the rear, with screens surrounding it.

## Advantages

- Extremely high hull damage output thanks to the torpedoes, making this ship incredibly effective against hulled ships.
- [Huge Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) have a very high maximum range of 12,000 studs, giving this ship the ability to outrange [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) (and most ships) by a wide margin.
- Very good for pirating large miners and freighters (Prepavaca, Orca, E Class etc.) with its high hull damage.
- Large cargo hold; especially efficient at looting [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) right after a successful siege.
- Good overall damage for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Moderately high alpha damage.
- Despite being primarily a hull breaker, it still has very respectable shield damage.
- Heavy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) have plenty of range and alpha.

## Disadvantages

- Lowest total health of all dreadnoughts excluding the [SR-71]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}SR-71), which has absurdly low health.
- Relies on its torpedoes for more than 1/2 of its total damage output; this, along with the fact that huge-sized torpedoes require a considerable amount of expertise to use effectively, means that inexperienced players will struggle to achieve the full potential of this ship.
- Turning and acceleration are rather sluggish.
- Is on the expensive side for a [regular]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) Dreadnought.

## Strategy

- The **Avalon** can be used as a hull breaker to dive hulled ships. However, beware of the ship's low health, as it will not be able to resist damage for long if full diving into a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and/or enemy fleet. Alternatively, you can try to place yourself out of reach, although hitting the torpedoes will become much harder at a longer range.
- Point your ship towards the enemy; this ensures all weapons have a line of sight and can hit the target.
- If you're participating in a [siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging), stay at a more distant range where your torpedoes will hit the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) but the base cannot fire back at you. If someone is tanking the base, you can warp in and use your turrets for extra damage.
- Pay attention and check the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) often to make sure you're not about to be targeted. Your relatively low health means you must always avoid damage.
- Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship. The Avalon can do a lot of damage, but being targeted greatly increases your chances of being destroyed.
- Encourage your team to bring more Avalons or other ships with torpedoes and at least one support ship for smaller enemies. A torpedo siege is a very effective and straight-forward way to destroy a starbase. If anybody in a large ship tries to defend the base, the siege ships can rip them apart while the support ship takes care of any smaller enemies. In the case of the Avalon, it can also perform somewhat as a support ship due to its multiple AA- turrets.
