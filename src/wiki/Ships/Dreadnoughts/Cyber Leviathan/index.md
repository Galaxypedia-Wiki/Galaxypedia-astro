The **_Cyber Leviathan_**is a redesigned version of the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan) made for the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018).

## Description

The **Cyber Leviathan** is a limited edition reskin for the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan), with a cyber, more futuristic appearance. It comes equipped with 9 [Quantum Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Appearance

The **Cyber Leviathan's** interior is similar to the Leviathan's interior. The only change is that the teleporter that goes in and out is red instead of blue.

## Advantages

- Great Turret Placement.
- Second-fastest [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) in the game behind the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream), with 130 top speed.
- 9 [Quantum Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) give it amazing siege capabilites.
- High health.
- Good turn rate for its size.
- Insanely destructive hull damage output, only behind the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion), [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia), and [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1); making this ship one of the best crippled ship killers in the game.

## Disadvantages

- Precise aiming of the spinals is HIGHLY recommended.
- Most weaknesses are in common with the standard [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan).
- Incredibly expensive.

## Strategy

- This ship's most ideal use is to chase down crippled ships, much like the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan).
- Like its non-limited counterpart, the **Cyber Leviathan** is also great at PvP.
- Decent for fleet sieges since most new players fear or have no idea what this ship is, causing even more fear.
- Utilize it in a fleet.
- Be extremely careful with this, as people are going to focus fire on a **Cyber Leviathan**.
