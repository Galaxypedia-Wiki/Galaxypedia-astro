The **_3d Printed Apocalypse_** is a [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with overwhelmingly powerful [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.

## Description

The _3D Printed Apocalypse_ is a ship that can only be acquired by paying 5000 Robux (~$60 USD). It is a very powerful turret-only ship with very high range, as it can be up to 7k away from it's target and still achieve full DPS. It specializes in [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage (457 DPS) but still has respectable [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage (333 DPS).

## Appearance

The _3D Printed Apocalypse_ exterior looks almost identical to the [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse), except that the _3D Printed Apocalypse_ is entirely white, including it's turrets. Unlike the _Apocalypse_, the _3D Printed Apocalypse's_ interior is a white featureless box.

## Advantages

- Good Shield DPS.
- Amazing Hull DPS.
- Tons of health, even more than the tanky [Catalyst]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Catalyst).
- Great range.
- Decent alpha.
- All turrets are on the top, allowing for warping under opponents to be effective.

## Disadvantages

- Slow top speed.
- Worth a ton, very costly to loose.
- Gets focused by fleets constantly.
- Struggles against smaller, faster ships.
- Huge blind spot on the bottom.

## Strategy

- Use this ship only when the risk of dying is very low, as large fleets will focus this ship even over [Super Capitols]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) if they see one.
- Diving enemy bases with this ship is not recommended
- Similar to the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement) or [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse), warping under your target is incredibly effective as all your turrets can hit, and they cannot hit you with all of their guns.
- Do not try to target small, fast ships as your turrets have subpar accuracy.
- If possible, shoot hulled ships to maximize your damage output
- Use your turret's range. The farther away you are from your target, the harder it is to land shots on you.
