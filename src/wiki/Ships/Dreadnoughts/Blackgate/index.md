The **_Blackgate_** is a [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020) [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that was available during Phase 3 of the event.

## Description

The **Blackgate** is a powerful [Event Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) with extremely high health and damage per [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) volley. It has a similar design to the [Cyber Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyber-Leviathan) and [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), with two large thruster-wing hybrid structures on either side of a thinner main body. The ship is largely black and grey in color, with some red highlights around certain central features. Its turrets are mounted along the top, front, and center of the ship and are rather hard to pick out against the similarly colored background.

## Appearance

The **Blackgate** has a very detailed interior with two floors and a futuristic motif. Multiple seats and monitors are lined up on the upper floor before a set of staircases leads down to the lower floor on which lies a 3d hologram of the entire ship.

## Advantages

- Extremely high health for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with a total of 17500 health points, making it very good for tanking damage.
- Good mobility for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Despite having unbalanced health, it still has good shield health.

## Disadvantages

- Blind spot at the rear of the ship.
- If you lose it, you cannot get it back.
- Overall relatively low damage output for an [Event Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships).
- 3rd most expensive [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) in the game, costing at least $1,342,000 credits including the pumpkins.

## Strategy

- Use this ship if you're confident that it wont die.
- Use this ship against Shield-based ships.
- Make sure to check the map/leaderboard once in awhile to prevent losing your ship to a raid.
