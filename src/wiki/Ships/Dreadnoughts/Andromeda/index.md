The **_Andromeda_** is the first [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-based [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Description

The **Andromeda** is a needle-like ship and is decently fast for its class. It also has a high spinal damage output for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). Recommended only for experienced players as it requires good aim and situational awareness to achieve its full potential. Its an extremely high risk high reward dreadnought, And recommended to use in coordinated pushes with teammates.

## Appearance

The **Andromeda** has a somewhat small interior, accessible only by a teleporter on the back of the ship. The interior is a wide room with a seat, teleporter, and hatch to a lower floor. The bottom floor has a desk with a chair and some containers. There are 2 papers with Contracts on them stating a remodel for [Banshee]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Banshee) and Project X-03. The Banshee Contract has a 250,000 [Credit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) agreement and the Project X-03 is a 20,000,000 Credit agreement.

## Advantages

- Extremely high total DPS if the user can aim [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) well.
- Great for taking down large, slow ships like other dreadnoughts.
- Somewhat high top speed of its class, having 20 less top speed than the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan).
- Spinals can be used to siege [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) from afar while taking minimal damage.
- Relatively cheap for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Disadvantages

- **MUST**be experienced with Spinals or your low health will catch up to you very quickly.
- Has trouble against smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Must own the [Galaxy VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) to build this ship.
- Vulnerable backside.
- No Turrets.
- Has the third lowest total health of all Dreadnoughts, only beaten by the [SR-71]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}SR-71) stealth dreadnought, and the Avalon
- Its unique shape and bright colors make it easy to identify from a distance.
- Low health (for a dreadnought) and acceleration makes attempting to fight many smaller, more agile ships a dangerous prospect.

## Strategy

- Use [Warp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) to quickly reposition if you get caught in a bad spot.
- Make sure to not attack ships or [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) without another ship with Anti-[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)/Anti-[Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) capabilities.
- Use the range of its Spinals to outgun other Dreadnoughts effectively.
- Use it as an extra gun during sieges, its main strong suit is DPS.
- Best used in fleet wars, let your teammates tank while you do huge damage to the enemies.
