The **_Jupiter_** is [**Limited**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) added during the [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020).

## Description

The **Jupiter** is a massive, shield-breaking dreadnought based on the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus). It is from the first part of the 2020 Halloween 2020 Event.

## Appearance

The **Jupiter** has no interior; it's just a black box with a purple seat and teleporter.

## Advantages

- Great firepower towards [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- High Shield health.
- Fairly good mobility for a Dreadnought.
- Higher total health than its regular counterpart.

## Disadvantages

- [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse) upgrades (from level 1) cost a staggering $2,358,250 Credits.
- It's very high cost of $1,679,790 credits and the fact that it's a limited ship makes it a massive target.
- Rather low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health.

## Strategy

- Focus on shielded ships to deal as much damage as possible.

## Version history

- Cargo Hold increased from 0 to 250 in version .69b1
- Explosion Size 750 ----> 880 .75a12
- Cargo Hold increased from 250 to 3200 in an unknown version

## Trivia

- Added in the first stage of the Halloween Event 2020.
- The :cost command's calculation for the value of [Gamma Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gamma-Pumpkin) used to put this ship's price at over 1.6 million credits. This was fixed when calculations were changed to not include the price of Pumpkins.
- Jupiter is the Roman name for Zeus, which fits as this ship is a limited reskin of the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus).
- Was once the only Dreadnought without any Cargo Hold.
