The **_Azrael_**is a powerful [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that was part of the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019).

## Description

The **Azrael** is a mid-range turret-focused variant of the [Abaddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abaddon).

This ship excels at providing firepower support in fleets against capital ships and [Diving]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) Ships with it's extremely high firepower.

## Appearance

The Azrael is a very futuristic and slim [dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with many fins jutting out of the ship, similar to the [Abaddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abaddon). At the front are its 6 Spinal Barrels which gives off an effect. The Ship's design somewhat resembles an aquatic creature.

The **Azrael** shares the same interior as the [Abaddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abaddon) and [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer), with a black, foggy hallway. At the front, there is a yellow glowing orb with electricity coming out of it, and in front of it there is yellow text that says <span style="color:#50e1f8">_"***SANCTION AZREAL ONLINE***"_</span>. This is not a typo, the ship used to be called the _Azreal_, spelled wrong, but was later changed. ![Ambience of

## Advantages

- Extremely high firepower for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Has a thin structure making it rather difficult to hit with weapons when facing towards an opponent.
- Fantastic for PvP against other Capital ships due to its firepower.
- Good maneuverability for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with a turn speed of .

## Disadvantages

- Must be facing towards the target to use all weapons.
- Azrael's [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) have poor arcs and they can be difficult to get used to.
- Large [Blindspots]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) underneath and on the back of the ship.
- Extremely expensive for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), having high Material Costs and costing a Class B [Permit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permits).
- The extremely loud ambient noises can be heard from almost all across the map.

## Strategies

- Try not to engage small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), as your Turrets are not accurate enough to hit them.
- Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.
- It is very good at brawling other Capital ships, with strong [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower and high turnspeed.
- It cannot support itself well without a fleet, so try staying in a fleet.
- Avoid swarms of small, agile ships; your turrets aren't accurate enough to hit and destroy them, on top of your size and maneuverability making easy for the swarms to stay in your blind-spots. Bring support ships if possible to protect yourself.
