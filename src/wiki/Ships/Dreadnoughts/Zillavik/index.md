{{< notices/limitedShip >}}

The **_Zillavik_** is a powerful **[Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)** which was added in the [Halloween Event 2021]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).

== Description == The **Zillavik** is a small [dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that shares design traits with the [Nautilus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nautilus). It could be obtained from the same place that Nautilus's quest was found before the event. It is a small, fast [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull)-shredder that is considered the strongest ship of its respective event.

## Interior

The interior consists of a small room, with two slightly different levels. The seat is a pink chamber that tapers towards the roof and is surrounded by multiple floating pink screens. The slightly raised level contains very little apart from a pad which does nothing.

## Advantages

- Perfectly balanced healthpool.
- High speed and small profile considering its class.
- Very good [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement, almost no blind spots.
- Extremely high damage to [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull).
- Despite no [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields)-breaking turrets, it still does rather high damage to shields.
- Large cargo for a [dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Disadvantages

- Shield damage requires good [spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) aim.
- Extremely expensive, being one of the most expensive ships in its event, now requires a C-Class permit.
- Limited, making it a large target for [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Slow turnspeed for a ship with powerful spinals
- Has some spots where only a few [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) can hit enemies.
- The turrets don't have much range.

## Strategy

- Only use this ship alone when fighting ships that you are sure are weaker than you.
- Avoid fights with ships that boast high [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health, like the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement) and [Lazarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lazarus).
- Use your high [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) damage to decimate ships with high hull health such as [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon).
- Pair up with a shield-breaker like [Crescendo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Crescendo), [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus), or [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius), to boost your effectiveness in battle.

## Trivia

- The first person to lose a **Zillavik** was s_matias12, ironically to NecroSlayerTyphoon's **Zillavik**.
- Nicknamed "Big [Nautilus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nautilus)" by players, due to its resemblance to its smaller sister ship.
- The first kill with a **Zillavik** was made by Silverhawk700000. He killed Incarnate102's Zero.
