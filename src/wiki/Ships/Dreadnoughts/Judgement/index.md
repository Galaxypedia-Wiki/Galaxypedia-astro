{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Judgement_**is a Shield-oriented Support/PvP [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). It is an extremely good ship for the destruction of large ships.

## Description

The **Judgement**is a sturdy [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that deals high long-range [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) damage and has massive Shield health, making it useful for [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) tanking and [sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging).

## Appearance

The **Judgement** is white, with neon blue near it's wings. The [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) logo can be seen on its sides, as well as the text "Judgement-class Dreadnought" on both sides of the mid-bow of the ship. The entrance teleporter leads to a tall room with several displays in front of the seat, with three of them being mounted on a desk; representing a personal computer. Behind the exit teleporter (which is a small, embedded yellow square) is a door (presumably of that which represents an elevator) that leads to a much larger room that houses the ship's reactor, which pulsates a light, neon blue color. The walls of the room have black stripes running all the way across as well as U.N.E insignias; and the floor has a lightly checkered appearance.

## Advantages

- Highest [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) HP of any dreadnought.
- Long range turrets can be effective for sieging [starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}starbase) while taking little damage.
- Can tank very effectively against kinetic weaponry due to the high shield health.
- High alpha damage is useful for scaring away players and destroying low health ships very quickly.
- High total health for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) (15,500 total HP).
- Warping under small ships can almost guarantee a kill.
- One of the best normal dreadnoughts for destroying crippled ships due to the high alpha damage and high health.
- Two or three of these in a group can be devastating from the sheer alpha damage alone, allowing you to easily cripple or finish off large ships.

## Disadvantages

- Amazingly low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health makes it incredibly weak to anti-shield weaponry (and shield breaker-type ships, by the same token), putting it lower than all Dreadnoughts except the [SR-71]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}SR-71).
- Very sluggish.
- Has a huge blind spot underneath the ship, which cannot be easily countered by turning due to the slow turn speed.
- Very large profile when not facing head-on, allowing even very inaccurate [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) and spinals to hit with ease.
- Inaccurate turrets can make it difficult to strike small ships outside of close range, and the turrets have a long reload time.
- Due to most of its health being [Shield-based]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), this ship struggles to tank Starbases from below, where a Starbase's turrets have the least lines of sight but also where the Starbase's heavy laser armament is focused. This makes the **Judgement** worse for using as a tank in sieges than almost any other Dreadnought, most of which have high Hull health or a good balance between Hull and Shield health.
- On paper the Judgement seems useful for sieging, and while it is able to siege, it doesn't do so very well in practice thanks to the mediocre damage output, shield-based health, and lack of defense against small ships.
- Unsuitable for most close-range brawling situations thanks to the poor mobility, long turret reload, and large bottom blind-spot. Best suited to hit-and-run tactics.
- Expensive compared to other Dreadnoughts.

## Strategy

- This ship can tank most other [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) without good shield breaking weapons, so make sure to know which are shield breakers before choosing to attack.
- [Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) stand no chance against your lasers and high health, kill all the aliens and kill the Punisher afterward. This is an easy way to gain money, considering that you also have 355 cargo hold. Be careful not to tank [Outriders]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Outrider) while fighting Punishers.
- Avoid heavy shield breakers, especially the [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius), [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) or [Jupiter]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jupiter).
- Use this to counter [Sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) from your own base(s) with its long-range weapons.
- Watch out for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) that may attempt to attack your ship after a siege.
- Can be useful against the [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) with its high [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), but be careful, as being hulled while fighting the [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) can be a death sentence. Try to stay close to the rear of the Decimator so it's forward facing weaponry cannot shoot you. Make sure to bring a ship with accurate turrets to support you, or the smaller aliens will be a problem.
- Get under [starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}starbase) and open fire on them to slowly drain the health away, and tank incoming fire so other ships in your fleet can open fire on the starbase. Beware of the fact that starbases do a lot of shield damage.
- Avoid tanking to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) at all costs, as the hull health is so little that it is a death sentence if you get hulled. As a general rule of thumb, start retreating when you have 1,000-3,000 Shield HP remaining (depending on the firepower you are being targetted with) to avoid being hulled.
- If your other teammates happen to have a **Judgement**, always try to use it in a group of at least two or more of the same ship. This allows you to ambush enemies with a combined alpha damage that will instantaneously cripple most normal [battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), if not destroy them; as well as having enough health to get away without being destroyed.
- If you find a slow [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) or a Miner like the [Commercial Miner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Commercial-Miner), warp under them and unleash your alpha damage. Two salvos will usually be enough to destroy them, provided your turrets don't miss. Keep in mind that the reload time may give them plenty of time to escape.
- **Always** utilize hit-and-run tactics where possible to minimize losses to your health, while still getting the most out of your weaponry.
- If you see a crippled capital ship attempting to retreat to its base, chase it down and destroy it with your heavy-hitting turret armament. Your [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) should be able to hold up against any defending ships and the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) for long enough for you to safely escape without being hulled. However, do not take the risk of warping into a very powerful defense fleet alone; and only do so with support.
- Never brute force targets, always micro-warp under them repeatedly to get out of their line of sight and unleash your high alpha.

## Trivia

- The previous **Judgement** model resembled a similar looking Ammarian ship from Eve Online called the _[Revelation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revelation)_.
- The current model is similar in appearance to the [Raven]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Raven).
- The original model was much smaller than the current model in-game.
- The [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) was added over a year after the **Judgement** was added, despite it being mentioned on the **Judgement's** old build menu description.
- Many use the ship for its alpha damage and tank capabilities; similar to the [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus).
