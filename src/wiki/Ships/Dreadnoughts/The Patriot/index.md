## Description

The Patriot is a powerful event dreadnought added during the [Fourth of July Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-Event-2023) and was re-released for the [Fourth of July Event 2024]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-Event-2024).

## Appearance

The Patriot is mostly grey with a few red parts. It has several engines in the rear that are lit up blue and emit a unique blue trail. There is a bridge on the top and two prongs sticking out of the front of the ship.

## Interior

The interior is nothing more than a white box with a teleporter and a seat.

## Advantages

- High health.
- Decent DPS for a dreadnought.
- Huge cannons allow for quickly finishing off a crippled capital ship.
- Turrets are good at melting away shield.
- Strong against shieldbreakers due to most of the health being hull.

## Disadvantages

- Hard to obtain; requires destroying and/or looting at least 2 Outlaws, which can only be spawned by admins.
- Will most likely be targeted due to its limited status and how hard to obtain it is.
- Huge profile means that spinals will easily hit you.
- When destroyed, **YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK!**
- Requires good spinal aim to effectively deal hull damage.
- Lopsided health means that this ship is weaker toward hullbreaking ships.
- Weak to swarms of small ships.

## Strategy

- Use sparingly, as this ship is limited.
- if you have other ships that you can use, treat this one like a trophy.
- Even though this ship is a decent tank, try to attempt to not tank due to the limited nature of this ship.
- If you do tank, know when to warp out.
- Use your total of 12 huge cannons per volley to finish off any crippled enemy ships and possibly steal some kills.
- If an enemy is retreating and is hulled, dive them and finish them off with your cannons. Your large healthpool is most likely enough to survive that along with earning a kill.
- Always travel in a fleet and NEVER alone.
- Warp to dodge spinals instead of relying on ship movement alone.
- Trust few to none.

## Version History

- Added in .76d
