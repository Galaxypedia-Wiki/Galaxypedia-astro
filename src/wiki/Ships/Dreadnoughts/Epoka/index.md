The **_Epoka_** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) which was added in the second part of [Halloween Event 2021]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).

## Description

The Epoka is a powerful Dreadnought with small emphasis on [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.

## Appearance

The Epoka is a very long [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that has a similar aesthetic to other [Halloween Event 2021]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021) ships like [Lillak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lillak).

The **Interior** is a simple grey box with the seat in the center; It is located on the back of the ship.

## Advantages

- Good overall [Hull DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang), at 350.

<!-- -->

- Very maneuverable for a dreadnought with decent turn speed and acceleration

<!-- -->

- Decently high, [Balanced]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) health pool across [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)

<!-- -->

- Only one [blind-spot]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) around the back

## Disadvantages

- On the weaker side of firepower against [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).

<!-- -->

- Struggles to fire all turrets at once, unless pointing directly at its target.

<!-- -->

- A large size allows the enemy to hit you much more consistently with spinals.

<!-- -->

- Most expensive ship in the Halloween 2021 event: (1.1M Credits, 550 Souls, 40 Forgotten Souls).

## Strategy

- Do not bring this ship to battle unless you are confident you won't be [Dived]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang).

<!-- -->

- Do not use this ship to tank against [Starbases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) or Fleets due to it's limited status.
- When fighting using the Epoka, try and stay pointed to your opponent so all your turrets have a line of sight.

<!-- -->

- Use this ship on those who are already [hulled]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) while let others do shield damage.

## Version History

- Added in version .74b3 during the second part of the Halloween Event 2021.
- Refunded, along with other [Halloween Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2021) ships due to broken models in version .75a10.

## Trivia

- The first person to lose an Epoka was TacoHampstr, to an Alien's [Plagued Preos Hatchling]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Preos-Hatchling).
- One of many [Halloween Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2021) ships that had it's models archived by it's creator, ap_ek.
