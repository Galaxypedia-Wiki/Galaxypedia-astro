The **_Retro Andromeda_** is a replica of the original [Andromeda Model]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Andromeda) **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)** added during the [Retro Ship Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2020).

## Description

The **Retro Andromeda** is a limited version of the original [Andromeda]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Andromeda) featuring the ship's original model and weapon loadout. Like the current version of the Andromeda, the **Retro Andromeda** specializes in [PvP]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}pvp-ships).

## Interior

The interior of the **Retro Andromeda** consists of a sleek but simple corridor to the pilot seat which branches off into two other similar corridors with little glass observation decks at the end.

## Advantages

- Small model making it harder to hit.
- Long range [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) allow it to attack from a distance.
- Large cargo hold.

## Disadvantages

- Slow acceleration.
- Lower top speed than its regular counterpart.
- Low HP for an event dread (even if it's better than the non-limited counterpart).
- Lack of turrets leaves it prone to swarms.
- Can only attack targets directly in front of it.
- Spinal DPS of 394 is lower than the total dps of its regular counterpart, which is 474.

## Strategy

- Keep your target in front of you or else you cannot hit them.
- Use the long range of the Huge Spinals to outrange ships with low range such as the [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest).
- Use it as you would use a [Jackal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jackal).

## Version History

- Description changed in .73a3.
- Cannon spinals increased from 7 to 10, Phaser spinals increased from 6 to 7, Cannon spinal Interval reduced to 0, Phaser spinal Interval reduced to 0.1, turn speed increased to 0.21 after the event ended.
- Explosion Size 450 ----> 910 .75a12

## Trivia

- Model resembles a squid.
- Only dreadnought with no turrets.
