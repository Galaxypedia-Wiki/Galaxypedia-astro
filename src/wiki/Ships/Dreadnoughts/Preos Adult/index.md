{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Preos Adult_** is the final stage of the [Preos Egg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Preos-Egg)'s evolution questline, added in the [Halloween Event 2021]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021). It resembles the [Plagued Preos Adult]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Preos-Adult) boss, which was required to be killed in order to make this ship.

## Description

The **_Preos Adult_** is a dreadnought that is the largest of the playable Preos ships. Being an evolution of the younger stages of the ship, it shares design traits and turrets with all of them.

## Interior

The interior is identical to the interiors of the previous Preos ships: a purple sphere with a holographic teleporter and seat.

## Advantages

- High health.
- Very high damage to hull.
- Extremely fast for its class.
- Smaller in length than most other dreadnoughts.
- Large cargo hold.

## Disadvantages

- Requires good spinal aim for effective shield breaking.
- Turrets are not very accurate.
- Despite its short length, it is rather large, making it a big target.
- Spinals have awful placement, being very far from each other, which makes it very hard to shoot ships smaller than a dreadnought.
- Limited, making it a large target.

## Strategy

- Never use this ship alone. Fly in fleets with ships you are confident will be targeted before you. Never tank for your fleet.
- Stay away from ships that are primarily spinal based, as they can hit the ship's large body with ease.
- Avoid smaller ships, as your inaccurate turrets will be unable to hit them.
- Pair up with a shield-breaker to maximize your combat effectivity.

## Version History

- Spinals moved towards the center .75a12
- Removed in version .75a37

## Trivia

- The first person to lose the **_Preos Adult_** was tremblayw1, coincidentally to the [Plagued Preos Adult]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Preos-Adult) boss.
