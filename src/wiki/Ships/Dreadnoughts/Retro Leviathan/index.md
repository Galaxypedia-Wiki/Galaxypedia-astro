The **_Retro Leviathan_** is a **[limited-edition]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** version of the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan) that features its original model and armament.

## Description

The **Retro Leviathan** is a limited [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) featuring the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan)'s original model and armament. Like its modern counterpart, the **Retro Leviathan** excels at [capital ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) combat.

## Interior

The bridge is composed of a relatively simple room with windows in addition to a large pilot chair and two passenger seats, although only the former can be sat in. Before the bridge, there is a short hallway containing multiple seats and a teleporter to the bridge.

## Advantages

- Has an overall large and balanced health pool, allowing the ship to take a considerable amount of damage before having to retreat.
- Its large cargo hold allows for a substantial amount of loot to be stored; perfect for pirating and looting bosses.
- Extremely high top speed and maneuverability for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts); has an exorbitant turn speed of **0.9**, allowing it to outmaneuver other Capital ships with extreme ease.
- Overall better stats and better firepower than the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan).
- High hull damage output with its 4 [Huge Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Large assortment of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) allows for versatility.

## Disadvantages

- Very expensive for a Dreadnought.
- Although it is hard to exploit due to the ship's very high turn speed, the underside is a weakspot.
- Total health and overall damage output are on the lower end for a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Strategy

- Be very careful when using this ship, as it will be hunted due to its expense and Limited status.
- Its weaponry and decent health pool allow it to chase down crippled ships very well.
- Abuse large ships' blindspots with your extreme maneuverability.
- In combat, warp and try to stay under your enemies; most of your turrets are on top of your ship.
- Try to hit your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) as they account for 1/3 of your hull DPS.

## Version History

- Added in Version .66b for the Retro Ship Event.
- Received a buff along with all other retro event ships in .66b shortly after the event ended.
- Gained 2 Huge Cannons in version .75a5.
- Explosion Size 180 ----> 940 .75a12

## Trivia

- The first player to lose this ship to another player was _2_1q_ to _AlikeBird_.
- The first of the three leviathan models.
- There is an admin ship that uses a downscaled version of this without the turrets, called the [Baby Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Baby-Leviathan).
