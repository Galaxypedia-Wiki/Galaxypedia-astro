{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Tennhausen_**is a balanced [**_Dreadnought_**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) commonly seen in Galaxy.

## Description

A [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) class ship created by [Xeiron Industries]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xeiron-Industries) and later updated by [Event Horizon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Event-Horizon), the **Tennhausen** is a powerful option for dealing with other capital ships.

## Appearance

The ship's interior consists of a simply designed room with a teleporter.

## Advantages

- Good [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) with a fast reload.
- High [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) damage against hull.
- Solid health pool.
- Low cost for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Features basic AA capabilities.

## Disadvantages

- Large blind spot at the underbelly of the ship.
- Struggles to effectively fight smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).

## Strategy

- This ship's strength lies in its ability to easily adapt to any new variables in a situation and its ability to tank a significant amount of damage which makes it ideal for defensive purposes.
- Stay under your opponent so all of your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can fire.
- Always be ready to reposition if somebody attempts to exploit your blind spot.

## Trivia

- The original model of this was going to be a Titan but the shipmaster heroXfight made it a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) instead.
- The **Tennhausen** has received possibly the most number of remodels of any [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- The **Tennhausen** and an old model is based on a ship of the same name in Rebel Galaxy.
- In Rebel Galaxy, it is a Frigate class ship.
- Once had an alpha turret on the top side. Most likely was a mistake or used as a placeholder.
