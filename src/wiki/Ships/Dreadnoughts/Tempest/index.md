{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Tempest_** is a powerful and fast PvP and Support [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Description

The **Tempest** is a PvP/Support [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) focused on escorting fleets.

The front of the ship has two Medium Lasers mounted on it at a slight angle giving it a sleek appearance, along with most of the other [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

As mentioned earlier, it is an excellent escort ship for fleets such as sieging fleets to take down small and large ships alike.

## Appearance

The Tempest's interior is rather simple, featuring an illuminated grey room with metal tiles for a floor and a neon purple ceiling. Near the teleporter, there is a logo, and at the other end a neon purple orb acting as the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Excellent Turret placement.
- Accurate yet high damage turrets help with pest control of smaller ships.
- Smallest blind spot of all Dreadnoughts.
- Versatility allows this ship to be flexible in its uses (support, PvP, assaulting, etc.).
- Good maneuverability for a Dreadnought.
- Somewhat high turret damage output for a dreadnought, almost being on par with the [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse); giving it high enough damage output to be an extremely dangerous threat to sub-capital ships that lack the speed to nullify the accuracy of the ship's armament.
- Rather cheap for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Disadvantages

- Lacks long-range turrets.
- Despite how small they are, the rear and broadside blind spots can be an issue if the pilot is not using the Tempest's maneuverability to their advantage.
- Less firepower compared to other Dreadnoughts
- Often gets targeted by fleets due to it's ability to counter carriers.

## Strategy

- Get as close as you can if you are fighting ships so your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can get in range.
- In order to aim all Turrets on a single target, you must aim the nose directly at the target.
- Try to stay in enemy blind spots to avoid damage.
- When fighting nimble ships, keep pace with them to the best of your ability in both speed and direction; to maximize the accuracy of your turrets.
- Support your team by providing AA (anti air) Support.
