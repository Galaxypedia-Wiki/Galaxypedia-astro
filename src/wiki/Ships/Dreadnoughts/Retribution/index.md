{{< shipInfobox >}}

**_Retribution_** is a multi-purpose **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)**.

## Description

The Retribution is a generic PvP [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that bears a close resemblance to the old [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon) model. It is modeled after the Cobra Class Destroyer from Warhammer 40k. It has good turret firepower and spinals but lacks defense against smaller ships.

## Appearance

There is a small teleporter located on the back of the ship, which sends you to a simple room with white floors and walls. The pilot seat is a short walk ahead. (just like the catalyst)

## Advantages

- Very cheap compared to some Dreadnoughts.
- Decent [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower against [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) of other [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Incredibly versatile, able to solo [siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) an undefended level 2 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) if used correctly.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) have a high Rate of Fire, allowing multiple chances to hit an enemy in a short period of time.
- Can cripple Hulled [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) if used correctly.
- Spinals can deal good hull damage.
- Wide variety of turrets, though not all of them can be used at once, lowering the DPS of the ship.
- Slightly above average tank.

## Disadvantages.

- Limited ability to fend off smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) after the dreadnought re-balance converted its medium turrets to large ones.
- Mediocre movement speed requires expert maneuvering from the pilot in PvP situations.
- Unable to fire all turrets at once due to poor turret placement; there will always be at least two turrets unable to fire from any angle(with the exception of broadsiding[where only one turret is unable to fire], which renders your spinals unusable).
- Slow maneuverability makes it difficult to give the turrets a line of sight and aim the spinals.
- Large and easy to hit.
-

## Strategy

- As much as it is a fierce [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), the **Retribution** is at its best when in a fleet.
- When in a 1v1 situation, use your mobility to your advantage. Attack from your target's blind spot.
- Make sure to approach from below your target, and only go head on if the target is a small [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) or [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) such as the [Sentaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz) or [Vigilance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vigilance).
- Never tank for prolonged periods of time in a [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging).
- Make sure to be ready to pull out in case the tide turns in your enemy's favor.
- When [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) in a fleet, park your ship at [Heavy Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) range (7000 studs away) and use your Heavy Lasers along with your [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) to attack the base, while not tanking too much damage.
- During sieges, your goal is to support core capital [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships). Be sure to fend off any defenders. Focus on enemy [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts); they can cause serious problems during a siege.

## Version History

## Trivia

- Based on the Cobra Class Destroyer from Warhammer 40K.
- When you walk into the cockpit, you'll see the words "**_I am the holy executioner of the heretic_**" above the window.
- Was stripped of any exterior design which most players protested and let to it being rarely used until the current model was added.
- A very detailed exterior just like the [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon).
