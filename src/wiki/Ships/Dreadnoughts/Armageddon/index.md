{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Armageddon_** is a hull-focused [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with powerful weaponry but low maneuverability.

## Description

The **Armageddon** has the highest [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) of any [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) in the game. The main centerpiece of the ship is the orb at the front, which is where the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) come from.

## Appearance

The interior is a simple but detailed room containing a teleporter from the front of the ship and the pilot's seat. In front of the pilot's seat, there is a screen attached to the roof that reads, "System Status:".

## Advantages

- Has very good firepower compared to other build menu dreadnoughts.
- Highest Hull health in its class
- Powerful Spinals that fire very quickly considering the damage that they can do.

## Disadvantages

- Large size makes landing hits on it very easy.
- Very low maneuverability, even for a dreadnought, which normally have low maneuverability.
- Vulnerable bottom.
- Rather poor turret placing; difficult to fire all of them at once, unless you're pointing directly at your target.
- Poor accuracy leaves it vulnerable to smaller, faster ships.
- Shield damage relies heavily on Spinal aim.
- Dependance on spinals for half of the **Armageddon** 's damage combined with it's low turn speed makes achieving maximum DPS difficult.
- Hull-breakers like the [Cyclops]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyclops), [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker), [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) can easily destroy this ship, or force it to retreat.
- Due to an update, this ship is no longer the cheapest, and is now slightly above 200 Thousand credits in price.

## Strategy

- This ship is best suited to fighting similar size ships, as its Large Turrets have low chance of hitting small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Make use of the **Armageddon's** powerful Spinals whenever you get the chance, as they are half of your damage and you may not win a fight without them.
- Avoid Hull-breaker ships such as the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker), [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon), and the [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris) as they have anti-Hull weaponry that can easily shred through the Hull of the **Armageddon**.
- The **Armageddon** is very powerful but has many large drawbacks that require careful positioning and situational awareness. This makes the **Armageddon** not very well suited for new players learning how to use dreadnoughts.
