The **Abaddon** is a powerful [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) added in the [2019 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2019).

## Description

The **Abaddon** is a long range, spinal-focused counterpart of the [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal).

This ship excels at [Diving]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) Ships with it's high alpha and long range, and powerful Spinals.

## Appearance

The Abaddon is a rather long and slim [dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with many fins jutting out of the ship including 4 Large inverted fins on the back. It has 2 Large Spinal Barrels attached to the front of the ship in a shotgun pattern, and these emit sparking particles. It has many windows decorating it's entire hull and the shape bears a striking resemblance to its sister ship the [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal).

Its shape and fins make it somewhat resemble a fish.

The **Abaddon** shares the same interior as the [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal) and [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer), with a black, foggy hallway. At the front, there is a yellow glowing orb with electricity coming out of it, and in front of it there is yellow text that says <span style="color:#ffd424">_"***LANCER ABADDON ONLINE***"._</span> ![Ambience of the

## Advantages

- High maneuverability, makes it easier to escape combat situations without taking too much damage.
- Good siege ship, Capable of destroying [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) with ease.
- Overall high DPS, from its [Spinal Weaponry]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- High alpha damage, being more than that of the [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal).
- High health for a [Dreadnought.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)
- Somewhat accurate turrets can hit ships as small as [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).

## Disadvantages

- Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.
- Unbalanced Shield Health compared to Hull, making it vulnerable against Hull-Breakers.
- Must be facing towards the target to use all weapons.
- Must be good at hitting [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry), as they make up most of the DPS.
- Large [Blindspots]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) underneath and on the back of the ship.
- Extremely expensive for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), having high Material Costs and costing a Class B [Permit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permits).
- People will know when it is spawned because of its ambiance being able to be heard from 100k studs away and people may also ask you to despawn your ship because of its loud ambiance.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.
- Pay attention and check the Minimap often to make sure you're not about to be ambushed. Your limited status means you must always avoid damage as much as possible.
- The Abaddon is decently maneuverable for a Dreadnought, but do not go against opponents who are smaller and faster than you.
- Use the high firepower on this ship to dive and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.
- Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship. The Abaddon can do tremendous amounts of damage, but being targeted greatly increases your chances of being destroyed.
- Stay away from Hull-Breakers like [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight), as your [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) has almost 1.5x the amount of your [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
