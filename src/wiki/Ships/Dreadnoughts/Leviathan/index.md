{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Leviathan_** is a **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)** class ship, the first of its kind to be added to Galaxy.

## Description

The once (and still) infamous **Leviathan** features a sleek design and excellent PvP capabilities to boot.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Leviathan** is a small room containing little more than the pilot's seat and the teleporter leading in and out.

## Advantages

- Fantastic at PvP against [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and other [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Large variety of well-placed [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- High [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage. Excels at countering the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream) and [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon) as well as finishing off crippled Capital Ships.
- Very fast and maneuverable for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), only slower than the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream), [SR-71]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}SR-71), and its limited [Cyber Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyber-Leviathan) and [Retro Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Leviathan) counterparts.
- Effective against smaller ships at close range
- Much better at exploiting weak spots than most [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Disadvantages

- Mediocre [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) capabilities.
- Only 2 [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on the underbelly, creating a weak spot which small ships can (and most definitely will) exploit.
- Lesser Cargo Hold for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Somewhat expensive, at 252,444 credits.
- Although good for PvP, stay away from other PvP ships like the [Andromeda]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Andromeda) as it's superior firepower can easily tear you apart despite it being more fragile.

## Strategy

- The **Leviathan** is an excellent [PVP Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}pvp-ships). The [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) layout and maneuverability make it difficult for other large ships to stay behind you, so use this as an advantage against other opposing ships.
- Its Maneuverability is best used for countering larger ships like [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and slow [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Use your quick turn speed and speed to your advantage to make sure ships do not go under you.
- Do not waste your spinals, more than half of your hull DPS comes from them.
