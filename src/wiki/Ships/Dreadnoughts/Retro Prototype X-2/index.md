The **_Retro Prototype X-2_**is a Retro Variant of the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2).

## Description

The **Retro Prototype X-2** is a "test dreadnought" based on the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), part of the [Retro Ship Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2023) where you could buy it from the Kneall HarbourMaster in a teleporter on [Aqueous II]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous-II) (see picture below).

## Appearance

![The location for the Retro Prototype X-2 quest teleporter, which is on

II.](Retro_Prototype_X-2_Location.jpg "The location for the Retro Prototype X-2 quest teleporter, which is on Aqueous II.") ![The room for the quest "Prototype X-2 Quest", which upon giving 2

Prototype
X-2](Retro_Prototype_X-2_Quest_Alien.jpg "The room for the quest "Prototype X-2 Quest", which upon giving 2 million quests to the KNEALL HarbourMaster, you will receive the Retro Prototype X-2") The **Retro Prototype X-2** docks with its back facing the starbase. Interior wise, there is a large walkway leading to a seat and a screen, which says nothing.

## Advantages

- Long range and fairly accurate [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Powerful [spinal armament]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Health is well-balanced and has a very high overall total for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), at 33,000 total HP; making it quite tanky.
- Spinals have 0 second interval, meaning they are fired all at once.
- Large cargo hold will allow you to loot valuable items fairly well from NPC ship wrecks.
- Much more maneuverable than the [Retro Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Prototype-X-1).

## Disadvantages

- Less durable than the [Retro Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Prototype-X-1), and does not have as many turrets as that ship; limiting its long range capacity.
- Extremely valuable target for superior ships such as super capitals, or groups of pirates; thanks to the outrageously expensive cost of 2 million credits as well as being a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ship.
- Large blind-spots below, behind, and to the side of the ship.
- **_<u>Massive</u>_** size makes this ship a very easy target to hit for even the most inaccurate turrets or pilots with poor spinal aiming capabilities; not to mention [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).

## Strategy

- This is a decent ship for diving battleships and other dreadnoughts when they flee to their base, tank with your health.
- Do not try to move out of the way of [Huge Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) with regular ship movement alone, as the ship is too large and too sluggish to dodge them. Instead, [warp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) out of the way of any Huge or Large Torpedoes that you see coming towards you; if you cannot afford to take those hits.
- This ship is heavily targeted due to its expense and limited status, so be considerate of the risks of using the ship in any situation.

## Version History

- added in version .76c13

## Trivia

- One of the most expensive Dreadnoughts released to date at an outstanding cost of 2 million credits.
- This ship is the original model of the Prototype X-2, which released in early beta.
- The first **Retro Prototype X-2** to die was **xAzreal's** to **Alien's** **Prototype X-2**.
