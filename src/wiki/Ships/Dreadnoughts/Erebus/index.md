The **_Erebus_** is a **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)** added during the **[Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019)**.

## Description

The **Erebus** is a Dreadnought from the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019) with high firepower and a resemblance to the [Grim]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim).

This ship excels at [diving]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) Ships and being a powerhouse in a fleet due to its firepower.

## Appearance

The Erebus is a mid-sized Dreadnought with a unique, complex, spiky and symmetrical appearance that stands out from other Dreadnoughts. On its front are 4 Orbital turrets and many spinal barrels sticking out centered around its most defining feature being its almost hollow center full of orbs.

The Erebus has a cylindrical shaped interior with a pilot seat that has a granite texture.

## Advantages

- High total health of 16,332 for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Powerful and [Balanced]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) firepower from its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinal Weaponry]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Fantastic for PvP against other Capital Ships.
- Extremely fast for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with its turn-speed and top speed.

## Disadvantages

- Large [blindspot]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) behind the ship.
- Inaccurate turrets have difficulty hitting anything smaller than a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Spinal firing arcs are spread apart, making it difficult to hit small targets.
- Will be hunted due to it being expensive and limited.

## Strategy

- Aim at your target and unleash all spinals to deal massive damage.
- When fighting other ships, use your high mobility to try and work your way into your enemy's weak points and blindspots.
- Use this ship's extreme maneuverability to cover for your blindspot and allow you to aim faster targets with your spinals.
- Don't travel alone on this ship during heavy wars, this ship will get targeted because it is a limited ship and it is really expensive.
- Use it if you are sure the risks are not too big, a skilled team can destroy these if you are not careful.
- Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship.
- Avoid smaller Ships, as your Turrets are not accurate enough to hit them.
