{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Ridgebreaker_** is a large, slow **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)**-Class ship designed specifically for [sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}sieging).

## Description

The **Ridgebreaker** is a strong hull-focused Dreadnought with 4 prominent [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) protruding from the front and strong [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower. Most effective when paired with the [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius).

## Appearance

You enter the bridge to find a red seat in the middle of the room, with a sign saying "Interior" on the front wall. Much like the [Lazarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lazarus) and [Cyber Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyber-Leviathan).

## Advantages

- Powerful kinetic [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) firepower, capable of obliterating the hull [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) of [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and other [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships).
- Very high [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Due to the position of the [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) barrels and the pilot seat, the [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)actually have 6800-7000 range.
- Contains shield-based turrets along with most of the turrets and all spinals dealing high amounts of hull damage.

## Disadvantages

- Incapable of fighting smaller and faster [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) effectively, if at all.
- Vulnerable bottom and backside.
- Slow, and not very maneuverable.
- Mediocre [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aiming skills needed in PVP.
- Spinal barrels are far apart, making aiming at close or even medium range, difficult.
- On the more expensive side of [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Mediocre [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.

## Strategy

- Use it as the main tank in [sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) for its massive pool of [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Try not wasting your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), a considerable amount of your firepower comes from them.
- Be sure to bring a shield breaker such as the [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius), that way your [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can do the most hull damage.
- Use range to your advantage during a siege; the **Ridgebreaker** has more damage at long range than almost all other [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Due to its reliance on kinetic weaponry, this ship is best used when a foe's [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) have been depleted. It may not be the best idea to be the one soaking up all the initial damage in a [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging), due to the fact you want your remaining health to last enough to destroy the [Starbase's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- A Combination of a [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) and **Ridgebreaker** can be a big threat, as they will dish out damage fast from afar.

## Trivia

- The original model had [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), which were removed prior to addition.
- The current model is based off the original **Ridgebreaker** model.
- The current model received some backlash by the community as it gives it a much larger blind spot on the underside of the ship but also praise as many players liked the original model's four giant barrels.
- Before rebalances, it was among the most powerful [Dreadnoughts.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)
- The second model is a reference to the [Ragnarov Titan](https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Ragnarov_Titan) from [Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion](https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Rebellion), although perhaps it took inspiration from [Destiny](https://www.destinypedia.com/Destiny)'s [Dreadnaught](https://www.destinypedia.com/Dreadnaught).
- Despite having a [Heavy Railgun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) before .66b, the **Ridgebreaker**did not receive a [Capital Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in place of said [Railgun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Previously had the lowest top speed in the game, at 14, now tied with every ship with a top speed of 45 as the slowest ship in the game, such as [Orca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orca), [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx), [Lazarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lazarus) and [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2).
