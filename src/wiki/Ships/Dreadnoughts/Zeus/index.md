{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Zeus_** is a [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields)-breaker **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)** class ship.

## Description

The **Zeus** is designed to destroy the [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) of large [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) and [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), it can prove a nightmare for other [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). It is also a prominent tank, having a very strong [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), but has proved to be an inefficient PvP vessel, as it is unable to finish off most of its opponents due to the lack of [Kinetic armament]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Appearance

The interior is just a very cramped box with a carpet square for a seat.

## Advantages

- Entirely [Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets)-based arsenal eats [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) faster than most non-limited [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Excellent [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) tank of itself.
- Overall high health.
- More accurate weapons than most Dreadnoughts
- Is faster and does more damage than [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) at the cost of long-range weaponry.
- Great against [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) due to the high shield DPS.
- No easily exploitable blindspots.
- Really thin.
- Highest turret-based shield DPS of any build menu dreadnought at 344.

## Disadvantages

- No Kinetic weapons means that it has no efficient way to break [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Vulnerable bottom.
- Practically countered by itself and similar [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) breakers.
- Must point directly at a target for all Turrets to fire.
- Low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health.
- Lacks long-range [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Strategy

- This is a good ship to use for [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) shredding while sieging or camping at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), since it can absorb a lot more damage than other [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) breakers.
- It's also a good siege support as its [Heavy Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) would bring down the base [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) while 2 [Heavy Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) give it a good defense against incoming hostiles.
- When against the Zeus, approach the ship from the bottom at full speed so that the [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) will have a hard time hitting you.
- Don't use this ship as a frontline tank as its [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) will quickly be drained by the [Heavy Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) from the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- This ship can be pretty good at scaring off bigger ships. Removing their [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) at a fast rate can force them to warp away, fearing for a possible dive if hulled.
- Don't tank during sieges, [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) mainly have lasers.
- Be the first one to attack, if you arrive later targets might be hulled and you won't be very useful.
- Know which ships are shield tanks when deciding which to attack. Ships with mainly shield health will often stand no chance against you.
- Since it can't do much hull damage, the Zeus is better suited for defense, as it can scare off attackers by quickly removing their shields and leaving them vulnerable.
