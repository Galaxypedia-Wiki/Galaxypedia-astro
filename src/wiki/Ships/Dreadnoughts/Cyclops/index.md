The **_Cyclops_** is a siege-focused[ **Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that is primarily focused on hull damage.

## Description

The **Cyclops** was the first siege [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) to be added into the game. It has decent [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 8 Heavy Cannons for shredding [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull). There is a [Vanguard Coalition]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard-Coalition) logo at the back of the entrance room.

## Interior

When you first enter the interior using a teleporter on the back, you are greeted with a room that has 4 chairs and computers. There is also a large hologram of a planet in the middle of the room. There are two small hallways to the bridge. The seat somewhat resembles that of the old [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), but blue.

## Advantages

- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) do extra Hull damage in addition to [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Fairly flat for its size potentially helping in dodging incoming fire when facing directly away or toward an enemy.
- Good firing arcs.
- Great [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable bottom.
- Cannot defend itself from small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) too well.
- Lacks Shield damage
- Very sluggish mobility, can be outmaneuvered by ships with high maneuverability easily.
- Performs poorly at PvP due to the sluggish maneuverability and poor overall damage output compared to other [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Strategy

- Use this for finishing off hulled [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- Try and find an ally with a [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) or [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) as the combination will rip through both Shield and Hull.
- Can be used to fend off other Dreadnoughts in an anti-siege. The starbase will cripple enemy shields, letting this ship decimate the weakened attackers with its high hull damage.
