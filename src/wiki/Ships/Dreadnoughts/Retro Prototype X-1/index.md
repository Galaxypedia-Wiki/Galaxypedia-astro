The **_Retro Prototype X-1_**is a Retro Variant of the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1).

## Description

The **Retro Prototype X-1** is a "test dreadnought" based on the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), part of the [Retro Ship Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2022) and [Retro Ship Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2023) where you could buy it from the UNE Harbour Master in Terminal C of the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) for 2 million credits.

## Interior

???

## Advantages

- High turret count with an armament well-equipped for [Sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging).
- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Health is well-balanced and has a very high overall total for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), at 43,000 total HP; making it the second most healthy dreadnought in the game.
- Spinals have 0 second interval, meaning they are fired all at once.
- Long range on the turrets(8,000 studs) allows you to outrange most other ships you will encounter.
- Large cargo hold will allow you to loot valuable items fairly well from NPC ship wrecks.

## Disadvantages

- Rather slow with low maneuverability.
- Extremely valuable target for superior ships such as super capitals, or groups of pirates; thanks to the outrageously expensive cost of 2 million credits <s>(and 1 Blueprint B)</s>, as well as being a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ship.
- Large blind-spots below and behind the ship.
- **_<u>Massive</u>_** size makes this ship a very easy target to hit for even the most inaccurate turrets or pilots with poor spinal aiming capabilities; not to mention [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).

## Strategy

- This is a decent ship for diving battleships and other dreadnoughts when they flee to their base, tank with your health.
- Do not try to move out of the way of [Huge Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) with regular ship movement alone, as the ship is too large and too sluggish to dodge them. Instead, warp out of the way of any Huge or Large Torpedoes that you see coming towards you.
- This ship is heavily targeted due to its expense and limited status. As mentioned in the ship's description, use with extreme caution.

## Version History

- Health changed from 9,500/9,500 Shield/Hull HP to 10,750/8,500 Shield/Hull HP, Top Speed reduced from 50 to 45, Turn Speed reduced from 0.12 to 0.1, Acceleration reduced from 12 to 5, Cargo Hold reduced from 1000 to 348, turret loadout changed from 5 Medium Siege Railguns and 4 Super LR Lasers to 5 Prototype Medium Railguns and 4 Prototype Heavy Lasers, [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) changed from 4 Huge Cannons and 5 Huge Phasers to 6 Huge Cannons and 6 Huge Phasers as well as the spinal interval being removed, and released in the Retro Ship 2022 event for the cost of 2 million credits and 1 Blueprint B as a quest from the UNE Harbour Master in version .75a5.
- Taken off-sale in version .75a5 after the end of the Retro 2022 Event.
- Cargo Hold increased from 348 to 1500 in version .75a5.
