{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Atlas_** is an oddly-shaped [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Description

The **Atlas** is a large [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) primarily based around sieging. Its most notable characteristic is the USSR emblem on the sides of this ship. It features two stubby prongs on the left and right front sides of the ship, with the rest of the main body being bulbous and roughly hexagonal in shape. Its turrets are lined up largely along the top and sides, making a front-downwards angle most effective in combat.

## Interior

The interior of the **_Atlas_** is well shaped with a large room containing a seat surrounded by a large screen set up. Above the teleporter and directly behind the captain's seat is the communist insignia the sickle and hammer.

## Advantages

- Many long range [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Very few true blind spots (defined as unable to fire in a certain area), and the true ones are easily countered by raising or dropping the ship's nose.
- Very high [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) health, coupled with decent [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health.
- Decent DPS.

## Disadvantages

- Inaccurate thanks to the large turrets and misses almost every single time against small ships.
- Sluggish maneuverability.

<!-- -->

- Turrets have lower range than [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement).
- Relies on the Capital Triple Lasers and Heavy Quantum Lasers for [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- As a limited ship, it is a large target.
- Shield health is almost exactly half the hull health.
- Just like with [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon), [hull-breakers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}hull-breakers) such as [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis), [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker), [Archeon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archeon), [Hasatan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hasatan), [Cyclops]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyclops), [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon) or even another **Atlas** can easily destroy this ship if its shield goes down.

## Strategy

- Always try to have a multi-ship escort because of its weakness in PvP.
- Avoid small ships such as [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) or [Destroyers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers), as they are hard to hit sometimes and can destroy you easily.
- Don't use this against hull-breaker ships, as they will destroy your hull quickly.

## Version History
