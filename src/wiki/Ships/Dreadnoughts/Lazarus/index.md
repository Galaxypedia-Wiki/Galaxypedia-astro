The **_Lazarus_** is a [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass)-exclusive PvP-based **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)** with high Shield health and firepower.

## Description

The **Lazarus** is a **[Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships)** with an astounding [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health and a very balanced firepower. While not being one of the most maneuverable **[Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)**, it can still inflict a great deal of damage to ships of the same size or bigger thanks to its powerful [Spinal Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) and [Kinetic turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). Due to the lack of [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull), it can be heavily countered by shield-breakers.

## Interior

The interior of the **Lazarus** is a small, very dark room containing only the pilot's seat and teleporter, and is entered via the teleporter on the back tip of the ship.

## Advantages

- Overall high DPS towards both [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull), focusing mainly toward the former.
- Triple [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) have a fast fire rate, making it a little easier to fight smaller ships.
- Can easily shred [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), other [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), Carriers, and even Bosses with low support.
- Very high shield health, great for countering hull-breakers such as [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker) and [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon).
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) fire from one point and all at once, making it easy to hit all the individual shots.
- Great DPS if you can use your [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry), especially against easier-to-hit bosses.

## Disadvantages

- Difficult to get full line of sight with the [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets), requiring careful angling and frequent repositioning even for larger moving targets.
- Lacks [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage without the use of its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Lowest [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health of its class.
- Multiple blind spots, most notably on the back and below.
- Shield breakers such as the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) and [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) will shred almost all of its health pool.
- Sluggish speed and maneuverability.

## Strategy

- The **Lazarus's** great DPS and immense [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields) makes it excellent for running into an existing battle or diving a [base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) then escaping without the enemy knowing if you are low on health or not.
- Deciding to escape battles with a few thousand shields is recommended to avoid being hulled. Players will certainly chase down a hulled **Lazarus**.
- Treat your shield health as if it were the entire health pool, because it pretty much is. Consider half-shields to be the equivalent of "hulled" and you will live through many more tough encounters.
- Avoid shield shredders like the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) or [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) as they can severely damage or even kill a **Lazarus** with ease.
- Be careful around [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), especially [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) and [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) as their high shield damage can tear you apart. An unsupported Punisher can be face-tanked, but if a Decimator targets you, retreat.
- Try not to let enemy ships get under you, as you there are no [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) on the underside of the ship.

## Trivia

- Previously well known for having the highest DPS of all build menu [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), however multiple other ships of its class have gotten higher DPS since then.
- The **Lazarus**Â currently has the second weakest hull health value for a [Dreadnought-Class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) ship, only higher than the [SR-71]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}SR-71).
- Frequently called 'Laz' for short.
- The **Lazarus**' previous model had some major meshing issues, which are displayed below.
- The **Lazarus** previous shield health of 9001 was a reference to the "over 9000" meme.
- Like with the [Sentaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz) speed nerf, acceleration nerf and turn speed nerf in version .69a2, the hull increase that occurred in version .68e was not mentioned by any developer, but it's hull buff was revealed in-game.![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}LazarusMeshBad.png-"LazarusMeshBad.png"){width="220" height="220"}
