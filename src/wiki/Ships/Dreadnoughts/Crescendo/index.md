_This page is about the player-ownable vessel. If you're looking for the NPC variant, see [Hellkeeper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hellkeeper)._

The **Crescendo** is a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that given in the second stage of the [2021 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2021).

## Description

The Crescendo is a mid-sized [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that is based off the [Hellkeeper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hellkeeper), but is significantly smaller and has nerfed stats than the ship it is derived from.

## Appearance

The Crescendo has crescent like shapes around its ship, related to its name and has a pink-purple color palette unlike the ship it is based from.

The **Interior** is a grey box with a purple light. It has a wall of text simillar to the [Halkaryak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halkaryak). There is a simple black seat found in the middle.

## Advantages

- Great [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) firepower.
- Has an insane overall speed for it's size, being at 100.
- Good shield health (9500)
- High damage to shields, better than the [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius).
- Fast turret cooldown.

<!-- -->

- It has an explosion radius of 1000 _(10k Studs)_, rivaling that of [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) nukes and can **severely damage even [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)**.

## Disadvantages

- Will be mass-targeted because of it being an expensive trophy ship in the [Halloween 2021 event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).
- Hard to land spinals on small / medium-sized ships.
- Unbalanced health (5555 hull).
- Big blind spot below the ship, but the turn speed can account for it.
- Extremely big hitbox for it's class, bigger than some super-capitals.

<!-- -->

- It's extremely powerful nuke will be a threat to your own fleet/team when your ship is destroyed.

## Strategy

- Do not bring this at wars unless you are confident that you won't die.
- Do not go alone with this ship inside of a war.
- If almost hulled, quickly warp back to your base.
- Can pair up with a hull breaker to form an unstoppable duo.
- To land targets with your spinals, make sure to aim more up than usual before shooting.
- Mainly use this ship to take down enemies' shields due it's anti shield firepower.
- If you think your ship will be destroyed, Warp your ship away as **far as possible** from your own fleet or starbase as the nuke has a whopping radius of 12,500 studs, and if possible, you can warp to the enemy's fleet or starbase to bring the nuke there instead.
