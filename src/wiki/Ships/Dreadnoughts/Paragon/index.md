{{< shipInfobox >}}

The Paragon is a quest dreadnought made by the [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) It is known for it's extremely fast speed and considerable damage.

## Description

The Paragon is a unique [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), it boasts the fastest speed in it's class, and very high firepower, although less than other [Quest]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}quests) [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). It can also be described as practically being the [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios), if it was a Dreadnought. It costs 20k [Silicate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 15k [Carbon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Iridium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Adamantite]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Palladium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Titanium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Quantium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1 [Paragon Thruster]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Paragon-Thrusters), and 500k credits.

## Appearance

The Paragon looks somewhat similar to the [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy), with it's long front end and four engines in the back. Overall, the aesthetic of the Paragon is similar to other [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships, such as the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), the [Venerator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Venerator) and the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement). It's coloration is made up mainly of grey, with silver and blue accents. Like other [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships, it features very little team colouration, which can be seen on the paragon as the only team colour is on the tips of its [U.N.E. Heavy Missile Launchers.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) The ship has a nonexistent interior, featuring only a black box and a team-colored pilot seat.

## Advantages

- High damage output for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Good balance between [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- Very high speed, higher even than the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream).
- Custom drift of 100%, allowing for very effective drifting, something unheard of for any other [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) (basically a [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios) in dreadnought mode).
- Has a somewhat flat profile like the [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios), making this ship difficult for enemies to hit while it is facing them.
- Relatively long range on its [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) allows this ship to be a good support ship in [sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging), especially since the Dual Autocannons are suitable for shooting down significantly smaller ships than itself, being [flak turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets#Flak-Cannons).

## Disadvantages

- Expensive, needing an upfront cost of 500,000 credits and lots of ores. Also require a special part that is only obtainable through doing enough damage to the [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold), which can often be hard to do. This also makes it a high-value target to many players.
- Lower damage output than other high-end, powerful [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), such as the [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator) and [Kraken]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken).
- Has a comparatively weak [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) when compared to its [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), making this ship vulnerable to shield breaking ships like the [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius), [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus), and [Nisos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nisos).
- Unlike its smaller counterparts with similar characteristics (including, but not limited to: the [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen), [Nightmare]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nightmare), [Atheon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Atheon), [Hallow]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hallow), and [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios)), this ship has a fairly large size thus its flat profile is not as effective at reducing incoming damage as much as them.

## Strategy

- This ship will be a large target, so be wary of players attempting to dive this ship.
- Use the damage output and extreme speed of this ship to get into a fight, deal damage, and escape before reinforcements arrive.

## Version History

- Introduced in version .77a19.
- Received three health buffs in version .77a22. hull: 8000 > 9500. Shield and hull: 12500/9500 > 17000/7500. Shield and hull: 17000/7500 > 20000/7000.

## Trivia

- The first person to lose a Paragon was xcelseor, who lost it to a [Kneall Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator).
