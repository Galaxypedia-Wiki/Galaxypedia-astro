The **_Catalyst_** is a large Support-PvP [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Description

The **Catalyst** is a durable dreadnought with decent weaponry, capable of being a versatile support ship in all situations except against swarms or when fighting small and fast ships. The balanced health pool of 32,000 HP allows it to tank in [sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) against a variety of bases, while the heavy-medium armament allows it to perform an-around role in PvP combat against other ships. The **Catalyst's** arsenal does include multiple very long range turrets, which again makes the **Catalyst** effective in seiges. However, there are a couple major downsides. The other, is that the ship suffers from awful maneuverability, which combined with the relatively poor accuracy on the armament makes it prone to being swarmed, or even harassed by fast [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Appearance

The ship is mostly light grey in colour, with some black and neon blue spots here and there. It carries a roughly rectangular array of thrusters in the rear and tapers out to a point in the front, with the ship gradually stepping down in thickness. The turret array reflects this pattern, with the larger capital turrets being set back along the sides of the ship and the medium cannons being lined up along the front and top. The interior is a large white room with red lining. The pilot seat is in the middle of this room, along with three white screens.

## Advantages

- Highest health pool out of any Non-Limited/Advanced dreadnought, having 32,000 Total HP.
- Can do considerable damage to both [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) at a close range.
- Can do decently in PvP against many [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Can do decent damage at a long range.
- Good LoS which covers most of the ship and allows the pilot to fire all turrets facing slightly downwards.

## Disadvantages

- Overall rather mediocre DPS, worse than several other build menu [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Heavy Turrets have poor accuracy, making this ship easy prey for swarms of smaller, faster [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Expensive.
- Struggles to PvP some high-damage [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Will often struggle to PvP [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) alone due to the slow turn speed.

## Strategy

- Try to stay under your opponent so all Turrets have a line of sight.
- Can do long-range support in a siege thanks to its Dual Heavy Railgun and Heavy Energy Lance
- Don't attempt to fight maneuverable or agile ships(including many Battleships) without support, as they can get and stay in your blind-spots due to the poor turn speed and size of the ship.
- If necessary, you can be the tank due to your VERY large health pool. But, do not recklessly tank in ship-ship combat, as you will most likely be shredded without doing much damage in return.
