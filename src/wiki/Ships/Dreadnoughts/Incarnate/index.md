The **_Incarnate_** is an event [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) from phase three of the [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020).

## Description

The **Incarnate** is a powerful event Dreadnought able to decimate any ships of its class and lower that dares to take on this ship.

## Interior

Not much in the way of an interior simply a teleporter pad very close to the driver seat.

## Advantages

- High overall DPS for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Relatively high alpha damage, at 2352 to [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 3240 to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Balanced damage to Shields and Hull
- Overall high mobility for its class
- A combined total health of 38,000 means it can tank damage quite well.
- High turret range of 8000 studs.
- Rather high cargo hold for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Disadvantages

- Very expensive costing over a million credits in build materials plus the exorbitant cost of a [C Permit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permits).
- Was only available during the [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020) and Halloween event 2023.
- Terrible accuracy making this only useful for killing battleships-or-above or destroying a base.
- Weak against smaller/faster ships.

## Strategy

- Use this ship only against bigger ships.
- Make sure to check the map/leaderboard once in awhile while using this ship to watch out for raids to kill your ship; limited dreadnoughts are both a blessing of a powerful ship and a curse of trophy hunting.

## Version History

- Reverted the Huge Cannon amount back to 4 in version .72d.
