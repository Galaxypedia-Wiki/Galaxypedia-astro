The **_Retro Cyclops_** is a replica of the original\*\* **[Cyclops-class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyclops) **[Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)\*\* added during the [Retro Ship Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2020).

## Description

The **Retro Cyclops **is a limited version of the original [Cyclops]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyclops) featuring the ship's original model and weapon loadout. Unlike the current version of the Cyclops, the **Retro Cyclops** is a [Siege]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}siege-ships) ship, though it can still do well in [PvP]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}pvp-ships).

## Interior

The interior of the **Retro Cyclops** consists of two nice-looking rooms. One room contains four sofas, and the other room contains another four sofas alongside two tables. The pilot's seat is at the front of the 2nd room.

## Advantages

- Large, balanced health pool allows it to take a beating from enemy ships.
- Long range [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) allow it to attack targets from a distance.
- Very high [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower; its high alpha damage (especially towards hull) and relatively low reload speed are a deadly combination.
- Large cargo hold.
- Good overall maneuverability.
- Top mounted Turrets allow it to fire on enemy vessels and starbases from below.
- Small for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Disadvantages

- Inaccurate Turrets leave it prone to swarms.
- Vulnerable bottom and rear.
- Its expensive cost and [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) classification make it a huge target for pirates.

## Strategy

- Stay under ships as much as possible, letting all your Turrets fire.
- Siege [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) from afar (8k) with your [Heavy Alpha Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Use it as you would use an [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse).

## Version History

- Hull increased from 4000 to 6900 in version .68e.
- Explosion Size 125 ----> 900 .75a12

## Trivia

- Looks very much like the [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership) and is often referred to as a "Mini" Mothership.
- Can capture [Aqueous II]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous-II) in 2 minutes and 15 seconds.
- Jeffenator_3000X was the first to lose one to Shad_owLord's [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris). He rebought it 3 hours later.
