{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Apocalypse_** is a [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with powerful [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.

## Description

The **Apocalypse** is mostly used as a siege ship or a PvP [Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships). However, the acceleration and overall mobility is lacking (it moves slowly up and down) which makes it vulnerable to smaller ships. It is capable of many tasks due to its powerful arsenal of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). This ship is even capable of Solo [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) a Level 1 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).

## Appearance

The interior of the **Apocalypse** is very detailed, more so than most other ships. The general design of the interior clearly takes inspiration from the U.N.E, as the interior is made up of sharp, angular parts. It has 3 different seats, all of which you can get into to see the 3rd person view of the ship, but only the middle seat can be used to pilot the ship. Each seat has the **Apocalypse's** logo on the back of it, and a screen in front of the ship. In front of the middle seat, there is a large screen covering the entire wall, which displays a model of the **Apocalypse's**, as well as "ALL SYSTEMS ONLINE//" and "The Apocalypse Has Arrived"

## Advantages

- High [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- Above-average turning speed.
- Very small for a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), Smaller than the [Loyalist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalist) which is a Battleship
- Good range

## Disadvantages

- Huge blindspot at the bottom- all weapons are mounted on the top of the ship.
- Lacks small [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower, unable to fend off smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- It can be overwhelmed by smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) such as a [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing), and [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova).

## Strategy

- It fails at attacking anything smaller than a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) or large Battlecruiser, as its weapons are very inaccurate. Because of this, always try to stay near a fleet.
- It is very good at brawling other [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), with strong [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower and astounding turnspeed, which is higher than most other [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- It can withstand a lot of damage from [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), but not very much from [Heavy Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It is still a good choice as a front line tank given its impressive health pool.
- If you see an enemy ship always approach from the bottom so you can be sure you will be able to hit them. If the ship is already below you, then you'll be taking damage with no response from you own ship's weapons.
- If dueling other Dreadnoughts, use your small and sleek body to dive under them and unleash your payload, they can't properly attack back. This is the most effective way of using this ship in both PvP and PvE.
- If your turrets have no line of sight, warp under the enemy ship.
