The **Galleon** is a **[Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) [AI]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)**.

## Description

The **Galleon** is a Pirate boss ship. Its model is rotated 90 degrees to have its broadside face opponents at all times. As a result, the front of the ship itself never faces its target, despite having Spinals mounted on its nose. It is still capable of firing them if a target manages to get in front of the nose. It has a large focus on hull health and damage, and is rather powerful against single opponents if it has sufficient support from other Pirates.

## Appearance

The **Galleon** is mostly brown, with some more metallic coloring for some parts of the ship. It has a massive chunk of ore smashed into its fuselage, with a singular Turret mounted top of it. Its design somewhat resembles mid 20th century American streamlined locomotives and trainsets. Its model is also an Archived, Recolored version of the old [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon).

## Behavior

The **Galleon** is a broadside ship and will try to align its broadside to face you. It also will call in Pirate ships, similar to the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) and other pirate bosses. It has a relatively strong nuke, at around 4k studs of blast radius and 1k damage.

It spawns every 70 minutes with no player count limit.

## Strategy

- Avoid both the nose and the left side of the **Galleon** as its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) are mounted on those parts of the ship. It is also recommended to use hull breaker ships, as it is a hull tank with low shields. If there are few or no other pirates, the Galleon can be easily destroyed with a single long range [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) based ship.
- Avoid using hull-tanking ships to fight the **Galleon**, as both the it and other [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) deal high amounts of damage to hull. A high damaging shield tank such as the [Lazarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lazarus) is excellent for this purpose.
- Alternatively, It can be brought to a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or [Planet]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) to assist in killing it. This can help remove any other [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) as well.
- The **Galleon** is extremely weak to long range ships such as the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement). Use your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) at a distance, and warp away slightly if it catches up to you. It may take longer, but is effective if your ship can't last long in heavy fire.

## Loot

The **Galleon** drops 6 [Plasma Batteries]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plasma-Battery), 150 [Armor Scraps]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armor-Scrap), and 1200 [Material Scraps]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Material-Scrap). Attacking it solo can give over 30k [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) in combat rewards.

## Version History

- Added in .72f1
- Disabled from spawning upon the release of the first part of Halloween 2021 for obvious reasons
- Re-enabled from spawning in version .74b17, spawns every 54 minutes instead, with Armored Platings in the loot being changed to 150 Armor Scraps
- Plasma Battery amount tripled (2 --> 6) in version .74b17
- Disabled from spawning during Christmas 2021 event for obvious reasons, it was re-enabled a few days after the event ended
- Disabled from spawning due to being replaced by 2 Pirate [Waspinators]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator) during the April Fools event 2022 in version .75a9, This was later reverted after the conclusion of the event

## Trivia

- Looks like an Emperor-class Battleship from Warhammer 40k.
- Uses an old model of the [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon).
- Due to the fact that broadsiding AI would require a different movement pattern, the Galleon's model is simply turned 90 degrees sideways, which makes warping and turning very strange looking.
- Galleon destruction can be a useful way of earning credits, since Plasma Batteries can be used for Uranium at the Mega Base, or for [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) at [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). 500 Armor Scraps can be turned in for 75000 credits, Depending on how much damage you deal you may get a good amount of Combat Rewards as well.
- Galleon's AI is considered to be very dumb due to how easy it is to avoid his shots and how he wont move around as much as the other bosses
