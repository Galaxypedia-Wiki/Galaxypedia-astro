The **_Blue Torp Wasp_** is a small **[Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)** built by [The Blue Torpedo Cult]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blue-Torpedo-Cult). It is an armored [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) with 2 Unique [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Description

The **Blue Torp Wasp**is a small [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates). It has two small spikes pointing out of the rear and has no [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It is armed with four [Medium Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry), which are unique in appearance and also unique to the ship. Unlike most other [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ships, it was built in the regular **Frigate** build menu.

## Interior

The **Blue Torp Wasp** has no interior. The exterior is simply a reskinned wasp.

## Advantages

- Carries four medium [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) that do around 2,000 damage per volley.
- Very small, making it difficult for [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to hit it.
- Cheap, costing 600 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) total. Even most newbies could afford it.
- Extremely fast turn speed.
- Good for stealing kills with its ridiculous hull damage.

## Disadvantages

- Low [health]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) makes it easy to kill.
- Was only available for 24 hours, just like the [Festive Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp), [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp), and [Disruptor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Disruptor) (although the Disruptor was released again).
- Was a Hidden event, Since there was a 24-hour time span in which most Public servers didn't get the update and never received this. You would have needed a private server to receive this.

## Strategy

- Group up with more **Blue Torp Wasps** to unleash your Torpedo fury!
- Never fight alone.

## Version History

- Removed from the build menu in version .66b (August 19, 2019).

## Trivia

- The **Blue Torp Wasp** plays music when spawned. (Music created by Scrapduck.) Just like the Prototypes, [Halloween Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Ship) (deleted/Unavailable), [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal), and [Abaddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abaddon)
- Fire_Ninja77 was the first person to lose this ship. He lost it to Jordvis321.
- Has customÂ Torpedoes.
- Has its own cult dedicated to it.
- The [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) has been "remodeled", but the **Blue Torp Wasp** still has the old model of it. The only differences between the old Wasp and the **Blue Torp Wasp** are the Tiny layers on the back and the black part.
- Just one of the 4 versions of the wasp to ever come out.
- Was released again in the new "Limited Edition (Permits)" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a E class permit (310k credits) + 60 Sillicate, 30 Carbon, 21 Iridium, 15 Adamantite, 14 Palladium, 13 Titanium, 13 Quantium, and 9 Uranium
