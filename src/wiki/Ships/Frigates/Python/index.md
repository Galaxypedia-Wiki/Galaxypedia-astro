{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Python_** is a fast and powerful [**Frigate**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Description

The **Python** is a Frigate Class ship. It has two [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), two [Light Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), two [Light Gatling Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and decent maneuverability. It has a recognizable trapezoidal shape and can easily be picked out among other ships.

## Appearance

A teleporter in the middle of a hallway: behind the teleporter is a Cobra Imperium logo, in front is where the seat is, along with multiple graphic interfaces and buttons near the seat.

## Advantages

- Speedy.
- Cheap.
- Can wear down shields quickly, with twice the firepower of the [Raven]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Raven) and the [Avenger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avenger).
- Great support ship.
- Has a high amount of turrets for a frigate

## Disadvantages

- Low health.
- Low hull damage.
- Rather large for a [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
- Not a good solo ship.

## Strategy

- This ship does not do well alone. But in a fleet, you can quickly wear down an opponent's shields while they are distracted by the larger ships in your fleet.
- Try to stay in the blind spots of enemy ships by using your superior agility so they cannot fire back at you.

## Version History

- Received a buff in version .61g adding its turrets.
- Received 2 Small Cannons ("G" Spinal) and Turn speed increased from 0.6 to 0.7 in version .65b.
- It's 2 Small Cannons were removed, one of its light lasers were swapped with a Light Flak Cannon, and it was given 2 Light Gatling Lasers in version .66b.

## Trivia

- This was originally going to be a [Constellation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Constellation) model, but then Iamawesome315 reshaped it and scaled it down into a python.
- It has a Cobra Imperium logo in it, and next to it are some scattered papers, one of which has Iamawesome315's character on it.
- Closely resembles a guitar pick.
