{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Worm_**is a small **[Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)** modelled after the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm).

## Description

The **Worm** is a [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm)-sized [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) with two [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and a Light Cannon, as well as a Wyrm-sized Cargo Hold. Its in-game description explains that it was specially designed for smugglers, [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating), and scavengers.

## Appearance

The **Worm** looks nearly identical to the _Wyrm_ from the outside. The pilot's seat is always the color of the player's faction. In front of the pilot's seat are a red screen and two joystick-like controls, similar to the layout of the [Archangel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archangel).

## Advantages

- High top speed.
- Has both a Cannon and Phaser, making it balanced in terms of [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- The highest Cargo Hold of any build menu Frigate.
- One of the cheapest [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
- Has higher [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) than theÂ Wyrm, and a total of 10 more health points overall.
- Good for hunting down stray [aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}aliens) and taking the loot to sell at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base)

## Disadvantages

- Low health.
- Spinals deal little damage.
- It has less hull health than the Wyrm.
- Its [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) won't do much damage at all, even if a ship is on [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Unlike the Wyrm, it cannot see wrecks from far away.
- Vulnerable underside.
- Terrible acceleration, being three times slower than the giant [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class).

## Strategy

- Never target ships such as the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos), since they can destroy you easily.
- Use the **Worm** like a Wyrm but with a little bit of defense.
- Fly in groups to maximize firepower.
- When attacking [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), you don't have to worry about losing your ship because of how cheap it is.
- Use this ship for Pirating.
- Don't forget that if you shoot another ship before docking at Mega Base, you will be in hostile mode.

## Version History

- Received a remodel in .65b
- Cargo Hold nerfed from 250 to 100 in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- Has a similar appearance to the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm).
- The **Worm**'s control sticks have a remarkable resemblance to those on the current [Archangel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archangel).
- Even though the ship's description claims it was made by putting armor on a [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm), the **Worm** has less hull health than the Wyrm.
