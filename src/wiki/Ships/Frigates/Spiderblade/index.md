{{< notices/limitedShip >}}

The **_Spiderblade_** is an old, redesigned version of the original [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade) made for the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017).

**_Not to be confused with theÂ normally buildable [Spider]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spider) [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)-Class Ship_.**

## Description

The **Spiderblade** is a cheap Event Ship from the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017) and was put back on sale during the [Black Friday 2019]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}black-friday-2019) sale.

## Appearance

This ship has no interior, just a single seat on top of the spider.

## Advantages

- Highest health for a frigate, comparable to some [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- The [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) can deal a whopping 1000 damage if they both hit at the target
- [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) have a very high rate of fire.
- Can easily aim at large ships.
- It has twice the amount of [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) compared to the original [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade).
- It has [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) compared to the [Starblade's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade) [Tiny Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- It has two Small Torpedoes instead of the single Small Torpedo of the original [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade).
- Very high [spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) damage output for a frigate, comparable to some [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Very high speed, which can help in dodging attacks from enemies

## Disadvantages

- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Phasers deal low damage.
- Slow for a [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
- Slow Turn Speed.
- Many players will want to destroy you since it's a limited Ship.

## Strategy

- Treat this like a trophy; Do not ever use it or spawn it. Only spawn it to show off to others. If you do spawn it, try to spawn it at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) so it can't be damaged. If you want to use it in combat, be prepared to lose it.

## Version History

- A second Small Torpedo was added in an unknown version.
- Shield and Hull increased from 500/250 to 950/550, Torpedoes increased in size from Small to Medium in version .65b.
- Was put back on sale for a limited time during the [Black Friday 2019]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}black-friday-2019) sale.
- Was released again in the Limited Build menu in version .72f; It can be obtained for 94 Sillicate, 60 Carbon, 31 Iridium, 15 Adamantite, 14 Palladium, 13 Titanium, 12 Quantium, and 9 Uranium (Total cost: 13,475 credits)

## Trivia

- The [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are held in the spider's web.
- One of the Limited [Halloween 2017 Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017) Ships.
- Usually gets confused with the [Spider]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spider) when doing the /cost or /info command in-game.
