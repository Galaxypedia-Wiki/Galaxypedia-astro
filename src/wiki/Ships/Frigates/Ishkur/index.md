{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Ishkur_** is a [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-focused [**Frigate**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Description

The **Ishkur** is a small [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates). To enter, players simply jump into the black area inside of it. It has a decent health pool for its class and, like most [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates), is only armed with [Spinal weaponry]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

The exterior design features a long pole that looks very similar to a weapon used for jousting. The shape of the cockpit area and the small handle-like attachment behind the pilot's seat mimics a horse saddle, further connecting the ship with the medieval competition of jousting.

## Appearance

The **Ishkur** has no interior. Almost the entire space that could be devoted to interior decoration is instead covered up by a dark black block that conceals the pilot.

## Advantages

- Decent shield damage.
- Cheap.
- Fast.
- Teaches newer players how to use [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) more effectively.

## Disadvantages

- Poor [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- Terrible Acceleration, having half the acceleration value of the [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class).
- Slow Turn Speed.
- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fire one after the other, making them hard to aim to hit fast targets.
- Requires good spinal aim.

## Strategy

- Useful for getting under [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and annoying them. Also decent for low loyalty [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- High speed and decent health makes it effective in attacking many large [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).

## Version History

- The ship received a major nerf in .62d7 that lowered its [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields)/[Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) from 450/450 to 290/290. This change also lowered the explosive range from 45 to 2, although its explosive damage remains the same.

## Trivia

- The model was loosely based off an EVE online ship of [the same name](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ishkur).
- The rear thrusters look like 4 legs.
