_Not to be confused with the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017) Limited [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)-Class [Spiderblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spiderblade)._

The **_Spider_**is a [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-focused [**Frigate**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Description

The **Spider** is a [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).Itdeals significant shield damage for a ship of its class. It is a decently fast ship. The ship is shaped similarly to the [Archangel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archangel).

## Appearance

The **Spider** has very little in the way of an interior. Inside, there is simply a small pilot seat.

## Advantages

- Decent speed.
- Ties with the [Abyss]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abyss) for the best turn speed in the game.
- Very small.
- Has an adequate armament of [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- A very good nuke ship, as it is cheap and does 250 explosion damage.
- Dirt cheap, Even [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) owners can mass-produce these.

## Disadvantages

- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- No other weaponry that can output more damage to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Low health, lower than some [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- You have to be able to aim [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in order to use this ship.
- Tied with the [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade) and the [Dropship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dropship) as the slowest [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Strategy

- Stick to other [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) from your faction as you are vulnerable and rather weak alone.
- Join up with an [Abyss]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abyss) to take down larger ships. You take care of the shield, and they take care of the hull.

## Version History

- Added in .65a.
- Explosion range reduced from 25 to 6 in .66b.

## Trivia

- When you type in /cost **Spider**, most likely you will get the ship costs for the off sale, limited edition [Spiderblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spiderblade) [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
