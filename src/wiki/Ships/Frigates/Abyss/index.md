{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Abyss_** is a powerful [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)-shredding **[Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)**.

## Description

The **Abyss** is a medium dogfighter [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) that can deal high [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage. It has a main body with two wings carrying two Large cannon shaped guns, each of which shoot 2 projectiles in a row (Except for the bottom left cannon which shoots a third projectile).

## Appearance

The **Abyss**effectively has no interior. There is a wooden chair that acts as a pilot's seat and a pedestal with a laptop on it.

## Advantages

- Extremely high Acceleration.
- Shreds [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- High mobility.
- Great for distracting a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- Great for finishing off ships that have been heavily damaged in fleet combat.

## Disadvantages

- Minimal [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) being tiny have a limited range.
- Lower than average health for Frigates.

## Strategy

- When fighting larger ships, never stop moving until you can get in their blind spot and fire your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Watch out for ships with Light [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) and the [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr).
- Get a small group of these, 5 or 6, and attack [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) when they get to low health. Don't attempt this on Starbases that still have [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health, as the **Abyss**can't break Shield very well.
- Team up with either [Avengers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avenger) or [Spiders]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spider) to dish out damage against Cruisers and Battlecruisers. They shred the shields, you shred the hull.

## Version History

- Received a remodel in version ???
- Remodel by Pleeber .75a27
- Buffed Health increased (200/200) -> (250/250) Tiny cannon count increased (7 -> 11) Speed decreased (300 -> 240) .75a27

## Trivia

- Before the remodel, it looked mostly green and wouldn't change color based on team colors.
- Before the remodel it was most likely the oldest model still in the game.
- The **Abyss** is great at diving crippled [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), as the 9 [Tiny Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) do lots of [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage while the small size and high mobility of the ship makes it possible to dodge incoming enemy fire.
