The **_Avenger_**is a fast and powerful **[Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).**

## Description

A classic Pre-Alpha frigate. The **Avenger** is a small ship with high maneuverability, making it great for hit and run attacks.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Avenger** is mostly empty. There is a small cockpit in the front that contains a couple screens and a chair.

## Advantages

- Very fast.
- Great ship for beginners.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are specialized against [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and reload fast.
- Decent [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower for a Frigate.
- Overall relatively high shield damage.

## Disadvantages

- Poor damage against [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- One of the more costly frigates.
- Exact same DPS as the [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade), but costs twice as much.
- Slow turn speed

## Strategy

- Support larger ships like the [Inquisitor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Inquisitor) by shredding the enemy's shield, then running when they get hulled.
- Team up with an [Abyss]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abyss) to deal some damage on Cruisers and Battlecruisers. You shred the shield, the [Abyss]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abyss) shreds the hull.

## Version History

- Received a buff in version .61g adding the two [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Received a remodel in update ????

- Before the old remodel, **Avenger** was based on a conceptual UNSC fighter from halo that was never implemented.
