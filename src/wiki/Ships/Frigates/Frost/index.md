The **Frost** is an [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) that spawned during the duration of the [<span style="color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;">Christmas Event 2022</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2022).

## Description

An extremely fast and small [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) ship, it will evade most shots with ease, making it difficult to destroy.

## Behavior

It follows the same pattern as most [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) ships.

It has a chance to spawn in 1-3 Groups every _3_ minutes.

_Note: Frosts can be force despawned if lead to the bottom or top of the map._

## Strategy

Use ships with high [Alpha Damage]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) like the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement) and get into extremely close proximity with a Frost to one-shot it.

Another strategy, is to use a powerful spinal attacker, preferably one with Spinals located in the center and smaller than a Battleship, like the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).

Using the spinal-based ship, **First,** warp to the target Frost until you catch it's attention, **Second,** **_Put your ship to a standstill_**, the reason is to make the target Frost fly to you in a straight line, then **Third** aim your spinal reticle in the middle of the targeting box of the Frost, then shoot away!

If done correctly, this method is easier than the other method above.

## Loot

The Frost drops 1-2 [Ice Shards]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ice-Shard).
