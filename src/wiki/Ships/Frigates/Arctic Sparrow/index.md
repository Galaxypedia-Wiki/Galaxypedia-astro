The **_Arctic Sparrow_** was a redesign of the [**Frigate-class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey) made for the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).

## Description

The **Arctic Sparrow**shares its general design with the [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey). Its color scheme has been changed to fit the holiday and it is draped in Christmas lights.

## Appearance

The **Arctic Sparrow**has a holiday-themed interior with a lit fireplace, several gifts (knockoff Lego sets based on old Galaxy ships) and a small sofa.

## Advantages

- Powerful Spinals for a Frigate.
- High Top Speed.
- High health for a Frigate.

## Disadvantages

- Since this is a limited ship it is often seen as a jackpot for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Lacking Shield firepower.
- Worse than the [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey) in several ways (lower DPS, weaker turrets, limited ship).

## Strategy

- Removed from the game, cannot be used.

## Version History

- Added in Version .65b.
- Cargo hold size fixed in an unknown version.
- Removed in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- It has a smoking chimney.
- Warm and cozy interior.
- Between the **Arctic Sparrow**, and its normal buildable counterpart, the [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey); the **Arctic Sparrow** exceeds in health by 330 (155 shield and 175 hull), Acceleration by 1, Turn Speed by 0.2, but has 6 less [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and 4 [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) instead of 4 [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- It is one of the ships to use the "Of course it has low health, it's made of snow!" running gag.
- It doesn't have [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey) in its name.
- Has different turrets to the non limited version.
- The **Arctic Sparrow** used to have 10x the cargo hold of a [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey).
- One of two limited ships based on the [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey).
- Removed from the game.
