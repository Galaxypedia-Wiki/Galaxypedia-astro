The **Macross** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) released during the [Fourth of July 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-2022) event (Rereleased during the Fourth of July 2023 event).

## Description

The Macross is a ship with a futuristic tractor-like appearance, equipped with a powerful array of [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) for its size; as well as decent durability. It is mostly gray in color, with blue engines and a [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth) flag on the rear behind the seat. A [Tiny Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) sits on the top of the bow of the ship.

## Advantages

- Powerful Phaser spinal array allows this ship to melt [shielding]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- High maneuverability combined with durability allows this ship to be a difficult target to destroy, even with point-defense turrets.

## Disadvantages

- [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) classification along with expense means this ship is a valuable target in the heat of any battle.
- Poor [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage output.

## Strategy

- Treat this ship like the shield breaker counterpart to the [Abyss]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abyss), and use it to heavily damage the shielding of ships larger than you that often have turrets that are not accurate enough to reliably hit you.
- Do not use this ship alone, as even though it is very maneuverable with a decent health pool for a Frigate; it can still easily be destroyed.

## Version History

- Added in version .75a12.

## Trivia

- Has a unique appearance that resembles a space-faring tractor.
- The first person to lose a Macross was Diegoawesome000 to Rayquaza200384's Freedom Galaxy.
