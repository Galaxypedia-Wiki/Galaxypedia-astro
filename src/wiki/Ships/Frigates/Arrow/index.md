The **_Arrow_** is a small and balanced [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Description

The **Arrow**is a small cruiser that features many small and tiny [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) as well as decent [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). The **Arrow** is balanced between [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage. The **Arrow** also gets about half it's damage from [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), which is very unusual for a [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Appearance

The **Arrow**has a simple interior consisting of two monitors with targeting information and power allocation, two joysticks and a respectable image of Clive Palmer on his way to defeat his foes.

## Advantages

- Cheap.
- Good [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) relative to other ships in its class.
- Great combo of high speed and small size make it excellent for dodging fire.
- Decent array of Tiny Cannons and [Tiny Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) make it useful for pest-control.

## Disadvantages

- The **Arrow's**' insane speed leads to poor turret accuracy.
- Poor [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health.
- Mediocre DPS.

## Strategy

- Drifting is the most effective way to play this ship so that you are always moving at top speed but still have your cannon facing your opponent.
- Avoid ships with many high accuracy turrets like the [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr) and the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos).
