{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Raven_** is a beginner's **[Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)** and the cheapest combat ship currently available.

## Description

The **Raven** is a fast and maneuverable Frigate that can distract and out-maneuver larger ships, getting into their blind spots. Its major weakness is its low durability, preventing it from fighting alone for extended periods of time.

## Appearance

The **Raven** has a detailed pilot's seat with cushions the color of the player's faction. In front of the seat is a control wheel and a radar/display screen. The right side of the cockpit also has a few buttons and a decal left by the creator.

## Advantages

- Decent [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) DPS.
- A solid ship for beginners.
- Fantastic for scouting due to its small size, disposable cost and basic functionality.
- Sometimes under-estimated by new players using larger ships, possibly ending with a quick comeuppance for the overconfident.

## Disadvantages

- Low amount of health.
- Hard to aim [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), unless you're fighting slow or large targets.
- Low damage output.
- Despite the **Raven**'s description saying it's a fast agile ship, it's actually among the slowest Frigates in both top speed and turn speed.

## Strategy

- Use it to distract [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and counter enemy [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Fly into large ships' blind spots and slowly deal damage.
- Avoid anything that has a Turret pointed at you, especially if the turret is high-accuracy (Flak Cannons, Point Defense Lasers, etc.)
- Staying at Top Speed is critical to limiting damage.

## Version History

- [Light Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) removed in some part of version .61 or .62.
- Received a remodel decreasing its size and altering its appearance in version .61g. A minor buff soon followed, adding its [Light Flak Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Trivia

- The **Raven** is currently the smallest and cheapest purchasable combat ship in the game.
- One of the most common starter ships.
- The Pilots feet pop out the bottom of the **Raven**.
- Some players will spam this ship. One player spent over 100k credits doing so.![Old Raven
