The **_Draco_** is a small and fast [**Frigate**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Description

The **Draco** is a very fast [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) that has a limited damage output. It is well known for its speed and its ability to distract [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) without high-accuracy defense. It has both [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), making it effective against [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health.

## Appearance

The **Draco** has a detailed interior space for a ship its size. Its cockpit has two control joysticks and a screen display in front of the pilot's seat. The seat itself is lacking in detail aside from the angled back and separate colors.

## Advantages

- Insanely fast frigate.
- The speed and shape make it hard to hit, especially for larger [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) have a high rate of fire.
- Great for distracting a base during a siege.

## Disadvantages

- Extremely weakÂ [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Minuscule Cargo Hold.

## Strategy

- Get a large group of these and use them to swarm larger targets.
- Use its high fire rate to heavily damage targets.
- When diving, fire 2-3 volleys, turn around and repeat to avoid incoming fire and to avoid getting too close to [bases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- Use it to distract [bases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) while other big ships are sieging it, or attack ships that are sieging your [base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- Avoid ships with a lot of Light [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) or [Gatlings]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in order to prevent damage.
- In dogfighting, keys Q, E, A, & D, your speed, and your tiny spinal weaponry are your friends. Strafe and drift to land more hits on smaller [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).

## Version History

- Was disabled during parts of version .62 due to model errors.
- The [Galaxy VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) was needed for the Draco, but as of .62b?, the [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) is no longer limited to [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) players only.
- Received a nerf to its Cargo Hold on .65a3.
- Received a nerf in .65a? removing 15 speed and halving the total spinal count (two tiny cannons/phasers).
- Recolored in version .65b.
- Received a remodel in version .67c.

## Trivia

- There was a short time period after its release in which it required [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) to build. However, after remodeling its [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) was removed.
- The new model was programmed with 4 [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and 4 [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), but an implementation bug forced all 4 of each weapon to fire simuntaneously, appearing as if only 2 of each [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) were firing.
- The Shipmaster Lordmonkeymonkey called out the ship's builder, FangABXY, claiming that he was the cause of the [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) bugs; including its remodel making the [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) tab unusable and its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aiming sideways.
- The current model's description was changed almost entirely, changing the species name referenced from Drakodem to Manjin, and speaking more in detail of the exact components of the ship.
- Its interior shares the control sticks with the [Archangel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archangel) and [Worm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Worm).
- Its pilot seat is similar to the [Archangel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archangel).
- There is a Halloween reskin of the **Draco**, the [Dragon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragon).
- The Draco's description says it has 4 phasers and 4 cannons, despite having only 2 phasers and 1 cannon because of balance reasons.
