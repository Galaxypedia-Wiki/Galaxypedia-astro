{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Viper_** is a highly maneuverable **[Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)**.

## Description

The **Viper** is the second fastest [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) in the game. This ship is good for distracting [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It is also one of the few ships to be almost completely white in color, aside from one main faction-colored stripe in the middle.

## Appearance

The **Viper** has a simple interior, with only a pilot's seat, a small black and grey cylinder without a known use, and a tiny screen showing a gyroscope-like readout.

## Advantages

- Extremely high mobility, one of the highest in the game if you don't consider [Admin]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) ships or the [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp).
- High shield firepower for a [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
- Can be used in swarms to overwhelm the [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) of larger ships.

## Disadvantages

- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Low hull and shields.
- Weak against hull.
- One of the most expensive Frigates in the game at this current state.
- The change in the way bases target ships has caused the **Viper** to be useless for distracting bases.

## Strategy

- It is very good for attacking [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) from below and dodging all return fire.
- It is an excellent choice whenever speed and small size are key.
- Great at attacking siege ships when defending your base.
- If you go to the height limit of the map and warp to an enemy base, you can give some support fire to a siege.
- A good choice for scouting bases before an attack by outrunning base [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- The heaviest of armies will fail to outrun you at top speed.
- Abuse your size in retreat situations.

## Trivia

- It is a replica of the _Viper_ Mark II from "Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome.
- It is a popular ship for newer players.
- rcouret's favorite ship.
- Has two event reskins, the [Patriotic Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Viper) and the [Golden Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Golden-Viper).
- Used to be the second fastest ship in the game at a maximum 330 speed, just behind the [Dragonfly's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragonfly) 380; however, as of update .66b, it is now slower than the [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco) and many fighters.
- Used to be one of the most popular ships to distract Starbase's.
- Often used to lure bosses to friendly bases due to its speed.
