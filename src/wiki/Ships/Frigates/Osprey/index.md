{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Osprey_** is a **[Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)** class ship with decent cargo and overall firepower for its class.

## Description

The **Osprey** is rather large and powerful for a Frigate, but still manages decent top speed and maneuverability. It has two main thrusters connected to the back wings. The front also has two large phaser arrays, making the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) easy to spot.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Osprey** is small, containing a bed, a chair with a computer, and a simple pilot's seat with faction colored padding. In front of the seat is a control panel with three main displays. The interior also has a decal left by the creator.

## Advantages

- Great DPS for a Frigate.

<!-- -->

- Good mobility.
- Decent cargo hold for a Frigate.
- Exceptional Turret firepower with its 8 tiny and small turrets.

## Disadvantages

- Average health despite great firepower, somewhat of a glass cannon.
- Relatively large size for a Frigate, making it easier to hit.
- The most expensive [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) on the build menu.

## Strategy

- Can be used as defence against [Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates), and [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Make sure to use your agility to your advantage and constantly move around to throw players off.
- Assemble a swarm for amazing power against larger ships.

## Version History

- 4 [Tiny Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Tiny Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) added in version .72c29
- Spinals removed in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- During Pre-Alpha, the Help button told you to start out by spawning an **Osprey**.
- Looks similar to the [Taipen](http://galaxyonfire.wikia.com/wiki/Taipan) from Galaxy On Fire 2.
- Had 2 different limited versions, the [Arctic Sparrow]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Arctic-Sparrow) and the [Patriotic Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Osprey).
