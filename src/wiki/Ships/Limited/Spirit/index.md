The **_Spirit_** is a [**Fighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) that only spawns in the [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx).

## Â Description

The **Spirit** is a fairly strong [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) that spawns only in the [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx), a limited ship that could only be obtained via the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017).

## Appearance

The Spirit is a recolored version of the original Nixesion model.

## Advantages

- Good firepower for a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters). (Higher than some [Destroyers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)).
- Good durability.
- Has two weapon types, allowing it to be effective no matter the situation.
- Easy to control since it moves slow enough for the pilot to react.

## Disadvantages

- Can be out-ranged easily.
- Larger than most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Can only be found on an extremely rare ship, the Ghoul Nyx.

## Strategy

- Overpower the enemy with swarms of **Spirit**.
- Defend the [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx) at all costs.

## Version History

- Health, Speed, Acceleration, buffed in unknown version along with Tiny cannons being upgraded to Small cannons.
- 5 Small cannons downgraded to 4 Small cannons, along with a speed and health buff in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- [Halloween Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017) re-skin of the [Nixesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion).
- Prior to **Spirits**, the [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx) had normal Nixesions.
- These are super rare, maybe going months before seeing any form of combat.
- They still use the old [Nixesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) model.
