## Description

**Noob** is a true noob. He has somehow found himself in the web of a giant Araneae. What became of him after [Halloween]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018)? Well, he was found in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) Observatory, still stuck in the web during the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018). However, he disappeared after the Event ended. He reappeared in the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019), only to vanish once again.

## Location

He was located near one of the billboards in [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

## Dialog

<u>Noob</u>: "Help!"

_Note that all secondary options (those that come after "or") will end the dialogue at that point._
