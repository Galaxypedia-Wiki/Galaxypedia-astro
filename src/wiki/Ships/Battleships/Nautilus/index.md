The **_Nautilus_** is a unique **[Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)** added unexpectedly on April 5th, 2020.

## Description

The **_Nautilus_** is an unexpected and powerful event ship added on April 5th, 2020. It is armed with its own unique Turrets called Enclaves, which float above and below their mounts on the ship.

This [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) excels at being a good support ship for Fleets, [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging). and [Diving]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang), with balanced [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) for tanking, powerful Laser [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) for shredding [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), and having long range cannons for [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging).

## Appearance

The Nautilus is small, flat [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that has an organic, aquatic look, has design traits with similar to the [Zillavik]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zillavik) and has 4 Triangle-shaped turrets orbiting it.

The **Interior** starts with a cylinder shaped teleporter, which leads into a small room. The small room contains a seat and a circular computer and screen in front, with similar coloring to the outside.

## Advantages

- [Balanced]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) DPS, a combination of [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) Cannons and high damage Laser [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- [Balanced]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) Health.
- Has high total health compared to other [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Has little to no [blind-spots]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang).
- Great mobility for a Battleship at 0.57 Turn-speed.
- Easily shreds most [BM]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) Battleships and can take on some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) if the pilot is skilled enough.

## Disadvantages

- Extremely expensive for a Battleship, costing 500,000+ credits if every material is bought from the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). This makes it as expensive as a [Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Slow acceleration.
- High warehouse level for a Battleship (most players experienced enough to afford this ship will already have enough space however).
- Inaccurate Turrets struggle to hit anything smaller than a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Requires good spinal aim for effective hull damage.
- The quest to obtain its blueprint is a one-time deal, making it Limited.

## Strategy

- Be careful when using this ship, especially during war, as it costs more than most [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Use the turrets to shred the shield of an opponent, and then focus on spinals once the target is [Hulled]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang).
- Only use it when you do not have Battleship loyalty or need a more maneuverable ship, since most Dreadnoughts and even high DPS Battleships like the [Panther]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Panther) can be more effective.
- Use your cannons to easily finish off [Hulled]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) targets or steal kills.
