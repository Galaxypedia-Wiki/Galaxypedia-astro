The Solstice is a Battleship that is part of the [2021 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021).

_This article describes the player-owned ship. For the NPC ship with the same model, see **[Cranefly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Cranefly)**._

## Description

The **Solstice** is an Avellian [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) based off the Christmas Event 2021 [Alien]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations) NPC, [Cranefly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cranefly). Its armed to the teeth with railgun turrets that will tear apart the hull of most ships, and equipped with balanced spinal firepower to retain effective shield damage output.

## Interior

The interior is a box, with a red pilot seat.

## Advantages

- Great kinetic turret armament allows you to shred the hull of crippled ships, while the spinals support the low shield damage output.
- Very few blind-spots.
- Unusual profile can make it difficult for Large or Huge-sized [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to hit you.
- Good cargo hold.
- Decent health pool.

## Disadvantages

- Limited classification means it will be targeted very often.
- Railgun focused turret armament means accuracy issues, especially with the Avellian Spike-L turrets which possess multiple barrels.
- Unbalanced health (4250/3000).
- Sluggish maneuverability compared to some other Battleships.
- Almost as expensive as a [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker).
- Mediocre shield damage.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship in a battle unless you are sure your ship won't be at risk of being destroyed.
- **Avoid** shield breakers like the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus), [Warden]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warden), and [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius).
- Do not sustain heavy fire; if you do, retreat to your nearest own or allied base.

## Version History

- Got a box interior in version .75a1; The seat was previously on top of the ship.
- Turret line of sight fixed, and spinals heavily nerfed: 8 Large Cannons un-multigunned and merged into a single barrel of 4 Medium Cannons and 4 Medium Phasers(resulting in a large reduction to hull damage output), in version .75a1.
- Explosion size 250 ----> 510 .75a12

## Trivia

- This ship was a part of the Christmas 2021 Avellian Fleet, as the [Cranefly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cranefly).
- Resembles a Caracal or Cerberus from EVE Online
