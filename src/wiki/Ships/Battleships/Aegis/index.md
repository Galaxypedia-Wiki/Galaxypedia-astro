{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Aegis_** is a **[Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)** that focuses on Shield health and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Description

The **Aegis** is a large shield-melting [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships). It has 2 prominent blast wings at the sides, similar to some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Appearance

The **Aegis** has a small teleporter on one front wing that leads to the interior. The interior has a pilot's seat and a small glowing control board. Behind the seat is a doorway and keypad that leads to a separate room with some crates and two counters, on which rests a Razer-brand toaster.

## Advantages

- High firepower from both [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- High [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields).
- Good mobility for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- High Acceleration for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Good Turret Placement.
- Amazing against ships like the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) or [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos).
- Icon is smaller than a normal Battleship, this is because the **Aegis**is smaller. This can be helpful when hiding under dreads then warping.

## Disadvantages

- Very weak [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Expensive.
- Easy to kill with [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damaging [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) like the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus).
- Not as effective against smaller ships as other battleships. Either the [Loyalist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalist) or [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) would be better options against faster ships.

## Strategy

- This ship can be used as a support ship in sieges with its versatile amount of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and can tank fire from hull shredding anti-siege ships for some time. It also performs somewhat decently in PvP.
- Instead of retreating when reaching [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull), you should to retreat at around 25-40% [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), since most ships will dive you due to the weak hull.
- Retreat when there is a risk of being overpowered. You can back off quickly due to its high acceleration.
- [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) will make short work of the **Aegis's** shields, so watch out during sieges.
- Due to the **Aegis's** large amount of [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and low amount of [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull), avoid [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) with a lot of [Laser Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) like the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus).
- A very powerful way to employ Aegis is in 1 on 1 battleship or lower, warping tactically right behind a ship or at least very close to get a full turret salvo off on an enemy ship, and utilize the [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals) after your large lasers have shredded their [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields). Doing this on a Battlecruiser usually results in the Battlecruiser getting very low or destroyed before being able to warp out.

## Trivia

- The **Aegis** had a limited event remodel, the [Glacier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Glacier), on sale for the [Christmas Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017). The limited event ship itself is stronger than the **Aegis** in health, but no longer looks similar to the **Aegis** due to its new remodel.
- The old **Aegis**looks similar to the [Ankylon](https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Ankylon_Titan) Titan from [Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion](https://sinsofasolarempire.fandom.com/wiki/Rebellion).
- The old ship model was flipped upside down after Beta, and was later buffed and given [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
