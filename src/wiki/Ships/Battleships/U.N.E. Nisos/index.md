_This article describes the NPC ship. For the player-owned equivalent, see [Nisos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nisos)._

The **U.N.E Nisos** is an [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Description

The **U.N.E Nisos** is a passive, [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) affiliated ship that is the equivalent of a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and has high extremely high spinal firepower for its class.

This ship almost never loses a fight because of its 'call' ability, where it calls all UNE ships around the map to its target. A swarm of these can take down a [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator), or a Level 5 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) (if they could attack starbases).

## Behavior

It will leave it's guarding post to respond to other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships' call for aid. Once the target is destroyed, it will return to the Starbase it is guarding.

It is able to call other U.N.E. ships to assist it in combat, similar to a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher).

However, since the bulk of its firepower comes from its spinals, it has a massive weakness in which once it goes close enough, it turns around in the opposite direction, losing most of its firepower, just like the [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator).

**Note**: The U.N.E Nisos, along with other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships, do not spawn in private servers.

## Strategy

- Lure powerful enemy AI ships such as a [Galleon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galleon) or [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) to it, if engaged, it will call other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships around the map to attack it.

## Version History

- Released in version.69f.

## Trivia

- Uses the old description of the [Nisos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nisos).
