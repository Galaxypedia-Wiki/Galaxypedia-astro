The **Naga** is a recolor of the [Alien Scourge]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Scourge), available to regular players. It has a ribbed/plated body with a curve along the top reminiscent of a spine. Large red flares blast out of the rear-top area on both sides of the ship, and the front end of the ship is lined with vein-like structures that run along the turret mounts towards the rear.

## Interior

It has an endo-skeleton and has a simple black sphere to sit in inside. Interestingly, the room is slanted and may be the only interior in the game that is.
