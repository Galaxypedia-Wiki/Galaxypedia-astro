The **_Brawler_** is a [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) Battleship from the 2nd Part of the [Halloween Event 2021]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).

## Description

The **_Brawler_** is a small battleship that functions similarly to its dreadnought counterpart, the [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator). As such, it is equipped with [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) weaponry.

## Interior

The interior is a simple, a cone-like room with a seat. It has barely enough space for the player.

## Advantages

- High shields for a ship of its class.
- Small profile and high speed.
- Balanced firepower.
- Turrets have high damage and are fast firing.

## Disadvantages

- Expensive, also required an [Alien Device]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Device) (unobtainable through normal means during its event).
- Low hull health.
- Will be hunted due to being a limited ship.
- Long spinal interval.
- When running teleporter is hard to reach due to extremely small interior

## Strategy

- Use this ship in battleship-to-battleship combat. Its small size and speed should help you avoid enemy fire, while you rip them apart with your rapid firing weaponry and spinals.
- Make sure to retreat before your enemy can get you down to your hull.

## Version History

- Added in Part 2 of [Halloween 2021]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).
- Spinals upscaled from Medium Cannons and Phasers to Large Cannons and Phasers in an unknown version.
- Explosion size 200 ----> 490 .75a12
- Name changed Bioicle -> Brawler .75a37

## Trivia

- Dubbed the "Mini [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator)" by players, due to its appearance being similar.
- One of the few playable ships of 100% Kneall design in-game, the others being the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) and the [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator).
- This ship had a somewhat unreasonable cost, since alien devices were unobtainable during the event unless you already had one or the materials for one.
