{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Legionnaire_** is a small [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) with a wide arrangement of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), making it effective in both short and long range combat.

## Description

The **Legionnaire** is a speedy assault [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that excels at supporting larger [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) during battles. Though it's nothing like the in-game concept of a destroyer, It very closely resembles a real life [Destroyer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:Destroyer#:~:text=In-naval-terminology,-a-destroyer,against-powerful-short-range-attackers.), and is played like one too. It has very powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) that allows it to wear down shield quickly and is very maneuverable. The front hooded [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) system is unique compared to other [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).

## Appearance

You enter the interior by using a bridge on the right side of the ship that leads to two rooms. The first is empty apart from the doors to the bridge and other room. The second room has the pilot's seat in it.

## Advantages

- Incredibly good hull damage.
- High [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) damage.
- Phaser [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fire all at once, instead of one after another.
- Variety of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) allows it to take on small and large [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) alike.
- One of the fastest Battleships in the Game
- Rather small for a Battleship, making it hard to hit.
- Very high maneuverability for a ship of its class.
- Very cheap for a battleship, being the 3rd cheapest, with the [Prowler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prowler) and [Warden]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warden) being cheaper than it.
- Balanced DPS.

## Disadvantages

- Exposed rear of the ship.
- Low health for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Cannon Spinals fire one after the other, there is quite a long time in between shots, unlike it's Phasers.

## Strategy

- This ship isn't that great at holding its own in a fight against bigger [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), so try and accompany larger [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) like [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) into battle to help them destroy the enemy.
- This ship is somewhat of a [Glass-Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archetypes), so dish out damage while remaining safe.
