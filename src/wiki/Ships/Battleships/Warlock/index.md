{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Warlock_** is a powerful [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) with a unique design and many [Medium Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Description

The **Warlock** is a long ship, with [Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Railgun Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) grouped together along the sides of the ship's body. This ship is well known for the ring surrounding its engines, which can be seen near the back of this latest remodel.

The **Warlock** can be used as a support siege ship since it has an array of balanced [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and great health.

## Interior

The interior of the **Warlock** is the exact same as the interior of the [Witch]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Witch). There is a small teleporter pad that leads to a hallway stretching nearly the entire length of the ship. The hallway has three wider openings with a set of three windows on each side of the openings. The middle opening contains one large pilot's seat and a faction-colored neon screen.

## Advantages

- Decent turret firepower with its 5 [Medium Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 3 Heavy Turrets.
- Great range allows it to dish out full damage while staying behind a tank during PVP and sieges.
- Decent health for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Great fleet support due to its versatility.
- Performs surprisingly well as a [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) ship due to the balanced damage the [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can deal.
- Decent maneuverability.

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable backside and only 1 turret on the bottom.
- Lacks [Small Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), lowering its effectiveness against small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Jack of all trades; master of none. Can't deal very well with being outgunned.
- Rather mediocre damage output, it is on par with the [Prowler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prowler).

## Strategy

- Pick your fights. You won't last very long in direct combat with bigger ships.
- Attack from below to ensure that all your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) hit.
- Try to move slowly behind [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) during a siege, let them tank, while you use your firepower.
- When attacking larger and slower ships, always stay underneath them or in a blind-spot using the Warlock's speed.
