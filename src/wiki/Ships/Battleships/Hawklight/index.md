{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Hawklight_** is generally considered to be one of the strongest [**Battleships**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) in Galaxy, especially as a PvP ship.

## Description

A popular [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) for new and experienced players alike. Many players have used the **Hawklight** for [Sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging); however, it also shines as a PvP ship. Its powerful array of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) allow it to quickly destroy ships of many different sizes. The placement of the Turrets makes it very easy to land the first few hits, but if facing more agile ships with turn speeds comparable to the [Gryphon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gryphon), the **Hawklight** will have difficulty landing powerful hits. One could consider this ship a hull-breaking counterpart to the [Warden]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warden), an extremely similar ship with a shield-oriented weapons array being the only feature that sets it apart from the **Hawklight**.

## Interior

The interior of the **Hawklight** is very alien-themed. You'll enter an empty dock port with a single teleporter to the bridge, and inside the bridge is a fairly detailed room with a single pilot's seat facing an orange triangle. The back of the triangle is another white triangle, and it is rather weird. There are two doors on the side that do not lead anywhere and cannot be walked through.

## Advantages

- Decent health pool, especially towards [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Perfect for destroying hulled [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) in a siege or counter-siege due to it's great [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)-breaking abilities.
- Cheap compared to other battleships.
- Quite fast for a battleship, allowing it to dodge some shots from heavier turrets.

## Disadvantages

- While it is not technically a blind spot, the bottom of the ship is rather exposed to tiny, agile Ships.
- Hard to damage [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) if you can't aim with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Several blind spots.
- Hull health is somewhat lower compared to Shields.

## Strategy

- It is a great ship for fighting [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) and other large ships like Dreadnoughts, however, do not attack faster, more agile ships.
- Like any other battleship, you will be focused in a siege if you are the biggest ship present, DO NOT be the last one out if your team warps away.
- Great ship for [Sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) and counter-sieges, use it for that.
- The\*\* **Hawklight\*** \*\*\*is effective at destroying Hull-Focused Opponents with its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Don't let enemy ships get underneath you, instead get underneath them to hit your Turrets or in front of them to fire your Spinals.
- Try and stay away from shield tanks, since the Hawklight is focused on hull.
- In PvP, never let your opponent get below you, always warp under them.
- Once hulled, immediately warp back to a friendly starbase or such and dock ASAP. As people will likely chase you down once they see that you're hulled. If they do follow you to your starbase, de-spawn and heal another time. Don't take any chances.
