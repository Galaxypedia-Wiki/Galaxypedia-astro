{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Nisos_** is a balanced ship, mostly used in [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) sieges.

## Description

The **Nisos** is a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that that can do a lot of damage to [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields). The **Nisos** is quite fast for its class, and has plenty of range from it's 2 Medium Energy Laces and 1 Heavy Laser.

## Appearance

You walk onto a teleporter, which leads to a small room with a desk, a chair, 3 screens, a picture of [SuperChip15]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff), and a model of an Alien [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer).

## Advantages

- Good speed, acceleration and maneuverability for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Has great shield-breaking capabilities.
- Cheap cost compared to most [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Nice mix of Alpha and DPS overall.
- Heavier turrets have great range.
- Good health pool.
- Despite the vulnerable backside, it is a very small blind spot.

## Disadvantages

- Low amounts of [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull)-damaging [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and spinals are very ineffective against hull.
- Large target, easy to hit with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Vulnerable underside.

## Strategy

- Excellent team PvP choice.
- Remember to back down and retreat if you encounter a [Dread]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) or [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) mostly based on hull.
- Using spinals are necessary to unlock this ship's full potential.

## Trivia

- The previous **Nisos** model was based off a ship from the game [Faster Than Light](http://ftl.wikia.com/wiki/Ship_Comparison). Said ship is also known as the Federation Cruiser B.
- It is also one of the least-known ships in the game, with most players unaware of its existence.
- Used to be a shield-breaker, but the [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) were switched for the anti-hull variants. Now it is back to being a shield breaker.
- The second model was originally meant to be a [Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock) remodel. Which explains the similiarities between them.
- Has unique [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) sound effects.
