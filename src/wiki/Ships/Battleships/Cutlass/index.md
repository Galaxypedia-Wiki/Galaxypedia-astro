{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Cutlass_** is a [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)-focused [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)

## Description

The **Cutlass** features a wide array of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), capable of dealing with both small and large [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships). It has very low [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health but [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health similar to some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Appearance

TBA

## Advantages

- A good array of Medium, and Large Turrets, allowing combat against a variety of ship classes.
- High Hull health allows this ship to effectively warp underneath a hostile base which focuses on shield DPS.
- Cutlass is the 2nd tankiest Build Menu Battleship, with its hull alone being the total health of some Battleships.
- Cutlass has very good alpha for a battleship (1344 shield, 1974 hull).

## Disadvantages

- Very slow and sluggish turn rate.
- Poorly defended bottom.
- Weak to Hull breakers due to low shield health.
- Poor AA, despite having medium flak cannons they do not offer enough AA for fighting swarms.
- Can only shoot above it and to its sides, easily divable.

## Strategy

- Use your variety of weapons to support a fleet.
- Adapt to many situations, as the ships various weapons can support many tasks.
- Steer clear of [Hull-breakers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}hull-breakers) like the [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon) and ships with high DPS, PVP-Focused armaments like the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis).
- Point your front under your target to make sure your Turrets have a line of sight.
- Target hulled [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) as your Heavy Railguns and Large Cannon can cripple them harder and potentially score a kill.
- Useful as a decent hull tank against shield-focused weaponry.

## Trivia

- The model was originally submitted as a [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) remodel.
- The internal layout and chair positions may remind some people of the interior of the original [Andromeda]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Andromeda) model.
- Ship doesn't dock all the way at [Aqueous II]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous-II), as the thrusters block the docking process.
- Largest Cargo Hold of a normal Battleship.
- The **Cutlass** is essentially the reverse counterpart to the Aegis Battleship; low Shields and an arsenal that focus more on Hull-breaking.
- The pilot's seat has a [Cultist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Cultists) emblem on it, owing its existence to their shipyards.
- Has the lowest shield of any Battleship.
- Currently has the highest total health out of all non-limited Battleships that are in the build menu, although its shield health somewhat defeats the purpose of a jack-of-all-trades ship.
