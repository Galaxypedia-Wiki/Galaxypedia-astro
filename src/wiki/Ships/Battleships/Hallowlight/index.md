The **Hallowlight**is a redesigned version of the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) added for the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018).

## Description

The **Hallowlight** is a redesign of the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight). It features different weaponry including two Halloween themed [Heavy Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and 3 pumpkins at its aft.

## Appearance

The interior is the same interior as the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight)'s old model. It consists of two chairs, one in front of a screen and the pilot's seat. The interior is accessed by a teleporter located at the back of the ship.

## Advantages

- High Health pool for its class.
- Decently defended against smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Hull shredding [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Good turret placement.
- Decent mobility.

## Disadvantages

- Has a weak spot under the ship.
- Targeted by [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates).
- Once you lose it, it can**NEVER** be recovered.
- Expensive for its class.
- The pumpkin above the cockpit area can hinder view when using [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Strategy

- Bring an escort of multiple [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) wherever you go.
- Your 8 [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) prove deadly to hulled targets. You should be able to kill hulled targets and run with a bit of shield remaining.
- Depending on the pilot using it, it can possibly solo some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
