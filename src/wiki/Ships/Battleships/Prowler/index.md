{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Prowler_** is a cheap but strong [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Description

The **Prowler** is a moderately fast battleship that is incredibly cheap, [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)-breaking and durable.

## Interior

The interior of the **Prowler** is detailed, with black and grey striped walls, a black floor with grey studs, and a black computer terminal with a holographic model of the ship in front of it, resembling the interior of the [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy).

## Advantages

- While not overly fast for its class, it does retain decent speed while also having fair firepower.
- Turns and accelerates rather quickly, giving it the feeling that it's faster than it really is.
- The cheapest Battleship available.
- Great for finishing off ships via Capital Cannon.
- Decent healthpool.

## Disadvantages

- The armament is directed more towards [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) breaking, it is rather ineffectual against small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Has a large profile, allowing it to be hit easily.
- Somewhat slow compared to other battleships.
- If you can't hit the spinals, shield damage is really low.

## Strategy

- Use the turn speed to keep all [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) pointed on your enemy as you use the phasers to wear down their [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Avoid PvP with larger, more powerful [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), as well as maneuverable smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- It is a very resistant battleship, this means it could tank more than other battleships.
- If you are fighting a big or medium ship, your turrets can easily pick on its hull rather quick.
- Use this ship to finish off other ships as its cannon weaponry will decimate hull quickly and has enough health to dive a ship back to its starbase.

## Version History

- Immediately nerfed upon addition in version .66b---Cargo Hold reduced from 1,750 to 200.
- Buffed in .66b, increasing its shield from 4500 to 4550 and its hull from 3350 to 3650
- [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) reduced to 3000 and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) reduced to 3350 in version .69a1.
- Part-shift fixed on the ship model in version .75a5.
- Explosion Size 80 ----> 290 .75a12
- Removed in .76d28

## Trivia

- Was originally planned to be a ship for Halloween, but was added in as a normal ship before it could become one.
- 1 of the only 2 battleships to have a [Capital Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), the other being [Snowfall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowfall).
