The **Onslaught** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that is a reconstruction of a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) from salvaged parts.

## Description

The Onslaught is a powerful Kneall-themed battleship sold by [cswimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}cswimr). It's requires 15k [Silicate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Carbon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 7.5k [Iridium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Adamantite]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Palladium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Titanium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Quantium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2 [Alien Devices]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Device), 1 [Punisher Weapon Salvage]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher-Weapon-Salvage), and 250k credits.

## Appearance

The ship is a bright yellow and white playable version of the [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Punisher)'s old model. The interior is an incredibly complex network of walkways and ladders that takes practice to navigate. Additionally, it is impossible to enter the seat without teleporting to it.

## Advantages

- Large Cargo Hold for a battleship.
- Custom rapid firing laser and railgun [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) gives this ship the highest turret-based damage output of any battleship.
- High speed and maneuverability for a [battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Small frontal and rear profile means that any inaccurate armament will have a difficult time hitting the ship, as long as it is pointed towards or away from the attacker.
- Decently balanced health pool of 19,000 HP.

## Disadvantages

- [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) classification means this ship will be targeted often by other players or pirates seeking to destroy high-value ships.
- Requires pointing directly at your target for all turrets to have a good line of sight.
- Costed 200,000 credits, which is expensive (for a battleship); but not as expensive as many other [limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) battleships or [advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) battleships.
- Effective range is greatly limited by the laser turrets, as they have far less range than the railguns.
- Despawning this ship may be difficult due to it's messy and hard-to-navigate interior.

## Strategy

- Support a fleet in [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) by utilizing the long range on your turrets, which is enough to keep you out of range of short-ranged weaponry or AA defenses.
- Chase down and destroy crippled [dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), that in most cases lack the accurate armament necessary to fend you off.
- Use the lasers to harass smaller or faster ships (like the [Constantine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Constantine)), as they are fairly accurate for the amount of damage they output.
