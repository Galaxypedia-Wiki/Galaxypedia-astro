{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Katana_** is an agile PvP **[Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)** that shares a model with the [Plagued Warship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Warship).

## Description

A PvP [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), the **Katana** was made with high [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and smaller [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) to allow for PvP accuracy. It shares its primary model shape with the [Plagued Warship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Warship), with a set of four arced arms near the back of the ship and a wide but somewhat flat front that tapers to a somewhat more square point. Its turrets are largely top-mounted with a multitude of autocannons placed on orbiting platforms above the ship.

## Appearance

The **Katana's** interior is a small undecorated square with a teleporter, a normal chair with a keyboard in front of it, and a strangely drawn and spread-out rectangle.

## Advantages

- Fast for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)
- Great [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields)-breaker.
- Agile for a battleship.
- High Shield health.
- The **Katana's** 7 [Light Autocannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can take out small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) very well.
- Powerful Shield-breaking [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) that fire in a "shotgun" pattern.
- The "shotgun" Spinal pattern of the Katana makes it easier to aim spinals while dealing enormous damage in close combat.

## Disadvantages

- Must be facing towards target to fire all [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Somewhat low Hull for a battleship.
- Has trouble docking at certain points (Aqueous II and Christmas Mega Base docks A-D)
- Requires [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) aiming in order to deal effective Shield damage.
- If you fight against a shield-breaker, you will be at a mediocre disadvantage.
- Somewhat low maximum range if you exclude the Spinals.

## Strategy

- This ship is great for [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating). Warp to your target, kill it, and warp back.
- Watch your health when using the **Katana** because you may need to warp out while still on [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) (~2000).
- Try to use **Katana** more in a fleet than alone because of its low health.
- If you are fighting against a small ship and you can't hit it with your spinals, do yourself a favor and warp away. Your turrets will take a while to hull the target.
- This ship is a glass cannon, boasting an oppressive 239 combined DPS, with drawbacks such as a short effective range for turrets (4.5k studs) and a total health pool of 9150.
- Use your spinals, as they boost your combined DPS from 122 to 239 (not including damage shield boosts or any other damage boosts)(DPS amount has been fixed.)
- Don't take risks during war, especially if your warring a strong faction, as they can easily swarm and kill you.

## Version History

- Top Speed reduced from 100 to 90, [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) increased from 1000 to 2000, 3 [Heavy Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) changed to 2 [Triple Heavy Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 1 [Light Gatling Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) firing interval reduced from 0.1 to 0 and Spinals received minor firing offset in version .69f.

## Trivia

- The old model looks a lot like an undersized [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2).
- The current model is the old [Genesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Genesis) model.
