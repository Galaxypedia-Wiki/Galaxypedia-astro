The **_Sentaliz_** is a [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-based PvP **[Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)**.

## Description

The **Sentaliz** is a [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) ship mostly used in swarms to kill large ships. As a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), the **Sentaliz** is lacking in hull but is able to compensate this with it powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry), and ability to consistently dodge both turrets and spinals.

## Appearance

The interior of this ship is quite simple, with a blue metal pilot's seat and a 3D display with three yellow projectors. It is entered by jumping through the cockpit roof into a seat.

## Advantages

- Very high hull damage output.
- Very small, similar to a large [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) in size.
- Excellent maneuverability for a ship of its class.
- Top speed of 185 combined with flat profile makes it very easy to dodge heavy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and even some light [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), as well as [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), which massively reduces the damage you take.
- Turrets, while not having great damage, do have a good range of 6k, which is helpful while sieging.
- Small Torpedoes have a long range of 6k, allowing it to engage enemy ships from a long distance.

## Disadvantages

- Minimal [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower
- Lowest total health in its class, excluding the [Stealth B-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stealth-B-2) and [Stealth One]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stealth-One).
- Weak to shield breakers, due to most of its health being shields.
- Requires the [VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) to build.

## Strategy

- This ship is incredibly effective at taking on other [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), as its very high speed allows it to get in blind spots and avoid being hit by heavy turrets while using the [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to deal massive damage.
- Be careful of any ships such as the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan) or [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest) that have high firepower and decent mobility, as they can deal more damage to you due to their higher accuracy.
- Use your speed to your advantage. Larger ships like the [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse) or [Behemoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Behemoth) can't turn to match you.
- Always position yourself in a ship's blind spot and unleash your [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fury!
- Try grouping up with other **Sentaliz** or spinal-based [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), as your combined strength is enough to take down any [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) or even Dreadnought in seconds.
- Use range to your advantage. Your 6 [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) combined with your 185 speed will allow you to finish off large targets.
- When diving, it is advisable to stay as far away as possible (6k range max) in order to dodge heavy weapons while finishing off hulled targets.
- If keeping distance is not possible, keep your speed high and get out as soon as you kill the ship you are diving.
- Watch out for small ships, as the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) and [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco), as they have the ability to dodge your lasers.
- Combining the speed and the [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), this ship proves to be effective at supporting [Sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) on Starbases and Planets.

## Version history

- At one point<span> the two turrets (1 [Light Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 1 [Light Flak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets)) were removed as the ship was too overpowered, but they were added back, then replaced by two [Light Gatling Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).</span>
- The original arsenal was 2 [Large Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), 4 [Large Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), and a [Light Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), but it was changed for being too powerful.

- Top speed reduced from 155 to 145, turn speed reduced from 0.55 to 0.5, acceleration reduced from 24 to 20, 2 [Large Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) replaced with 4 [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and received a remodel in version .69a2. The former 3 changes didn't had any further notice, unlike the latter 2.

## Trivia

- The **Sentaliz**, although being one of the more expensive [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), is also the smallest [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) in-game.
- Unlike most other ships, the **Sentaliz** has a unique appearance in that its wing pieces are not directly attached to the main body of the ship.
- The second battleship to be [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass), the first being the [Carvainir]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Carvainir).
- Has similar features to the [Aeaphiel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aeaphiel), which shares a common designer.
- It used to be very good at taking out [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), but various nerfs made it much more dangerous to take on [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) without being a skilled pilot or being in a group of multiple **Sentaliz**. It is now used more often to combat [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) or large [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- The [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) rebalance more or less reverted the **Sentaliz**nerf, making it somewhat viable to take on [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) again.
- It has a yellow trail when moving.
- It is built by [Xeiron Industries]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xeiron-Industries), as the wings have "Xeiron" written on them.
- Has a limited remodel, the [Santaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Santaliz).
