The **_Bone Ampharos_** is a limited edition version of the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) belonging to the Halloween Event 2017.

## Description

The **Bone Ampharos** is a limited edition version of the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) released during the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017). It costs double the amount of a normal [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos). Most see this ship as a collectible.

The **Bone Ampharos** is a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that consists of 2 heavy blast wings attached to the main body. It is great for defending heavy [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) ships during a siege along with defending a base against small [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) trying to distract the base's [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Appearance

Unlike the normalÂ [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos), the **Bone Ampharos** has little interior. On the back of the dragon's "tail" there is a teleporter which leads you to a small room inside the dragon's head. There is a pilot's seat in there made out of bones.

## Advantages

- Absolutely shreds small ships.

<!-- -->

- High mobility.

<!-- -->

- Decent [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

<!-- -->

- Extremely good at fleet support.
- Pretty fast for a battleship its size.

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable bottom.
- Not good against [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) or anything with high firepower.
- Can't siege due to the lack of [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and Heavy Weaponry.

<!-- -->

- Rare limited ship puts a huge target on your head.

<!-- -->

- You can't get it back if you lose it.
- Somewhat low damage for a Battleship

## Strategy

- It's close-range rapid-fire armament makes it ideal for fighting small, fast ships.
- Having multiple **Bone Ampharos'** alongside [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) (above, sides, and bottom) can greatly help them out. Small [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) ships can easily outmaneuver siege ships and it is the [Ampharos's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) job to keep them protected.
- It is a good ship for pirating or escort, however, it is not as mobile as other combat ships such as [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) or [Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grievion).
- Don't try to hit and run a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), you'll do little damage and the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) will leave you with a practically destroyed ship.

## Version History

- Shield and Hull increased from 3500/3500 to 3750/3750, Light Flak Cannons upgraded to Medium Flak Cannons in version .65b.
- Explosion size 80 ----> 450 .75a12

## Trivia

- Retains a previous ampharos model (but edited to fit the Halloween event theme).
