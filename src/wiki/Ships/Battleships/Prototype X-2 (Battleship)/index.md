## Description

The Prototype X-2 is a heavily nerfed, and highly agile, replica of the [:Category:Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2).

It can be obtained by paying 200,000 credits to the Alien quest giver, found by accessing a red teleporter pad on the top of the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

## Interior

The interior is identical to that of the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), with a metal door leading to a seat with a screen with "WELCOME, USER" written on it.

## Advantages

- Balanced weaponry
- Good, if not above average, health for a battleship
- Good shield breaking capabilities
- Damage output is surprisingly high at 450+ DPS combined.
- Great, if not ridiculous, turn rate.
- High speed

## Disadvantages

- No hull-breaking turrets
- Lasers have a long reload time
- Speed reduces accuracy
- Very expensive at 200k credits; considered by most buyers to be a waste of money.
- Limited, meaning it cannot be regained once lost.

## Version History

- Was removed along with [Prototype X/1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X/1) in version .75a10. Players who owned this ship and/or the X/1 was refunded.

## Strategy

- Use in swarms against bigger ships; got enough health and firepower to solo the [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher)
- Attack from underneath the enemy for shield breaking, and then attack head-on when opponent is hulled.
- Don't engage in any boss like scenarios since that won't end well due to its low health.

## Trivia

- The name of the ship is "Prototype X-2" With two spaces.
- This version of the X-2 is considered a battleship.
- The first person to lose this ship was azAZ458990 who lost it to seehyadued52's (real) Prototype X-2.
- Similar to other quest ships for April Fools', the quest required a large amount of credits at 2,000,000, but only costed 200,000 credits. However, it would take the 2,000,000 credits if the player had them.
- Quest giver's location for it is assumed to be (after teleporting from the Mega Base) in the [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold).
- Presumed to be a late April Fools' Day ship as a counterpart to the [Prototype X/1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X/1)
