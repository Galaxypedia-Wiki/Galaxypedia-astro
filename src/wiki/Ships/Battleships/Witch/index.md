{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Witch_** is a fast, stripped down combat **[Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)** modeled after the [Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock).

## Description

The **Witch** is a very fast [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and it is built from the same basic model as the [Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock). It has [6 Medium Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). The **Witch's**main visual difference from the Warlock is its lack of the engine ring near the back of the ship. This matches the "stripped down" description of the ship.

It's a very fast ship with a Top Speed of 110. It has (F) and (G) [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) which are 4 [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and 4 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Appearance

The interior of the **Witch** is the exact same as the interior of the [Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock). There is a small teleporter pad that leads to a hallway stretching nearly the entire length of the ship. The hallway has three wider openings with a set of three windows on each side of the openings. The middle opening contains one large pilot's seat and a faction-colored neon screen.

## Advantages

- Good speed and mobility, the fifth-fastest [Build Menu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) battleship (excluding stealth ships), the others being the [Sentaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz), [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos), [Jackal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jackal), and [Panther]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Panther) (in descending order).
- High overall firepower from both [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Lots of forward/backward turret range and lines of sight, backside is a very small blind spot.
- Flexible [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), still capable of hitting smaller ships while dealing reasonable damage to Capital Ships.
- This ship is a great [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) ship as it can tank low-level [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and kill miners even when they are close to their [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), while still being able to warp away.
- Due to its high Speed and relatively high general durability, diving is a relatively easy task, however it's not completely immune to damage.
- Great shield DPS of 254 and acceptable hull DPS of 209.

## Disadvantages

- Easy to swarm with small ships, or out-gun with heavily armed ships.
- Has mostly laser turrets so enemies' hull cannot be efficiently taken care of when only using turrets.
- Weak to Hull-tanks in general.

## Strategies

- It can be used to protect larger ships from fighters, using it's turrets, or from larger ships, using it's spinals.
- Use this for [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) as it has very good [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) speed and firepower, and is able to tank [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) shortly to finish ships off.
- The **Witch** is highly recommended for PvP, as the **Witch** has an amazing balance of speed, firepower, range, durability, and cost.
- Great for use as a fleet ship, as it has enough smaller turrets and speed to kill smaller ships attacking your fleet, but can also deal out large DPS against large targets.
