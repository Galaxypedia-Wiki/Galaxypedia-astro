{{< notices/advancedShip >}}

The **_Imperator_** is a large and tanky [Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) **[Battleship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:battleship)**.

## Description

The **Imperator** is a very powerful [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and _was_ the first of its class to require artifacts to build.

What the Imperator lacks in speed and size it makes up for total its sheer Health. This Ship excels at being one of the flagships in a fleet due to it's health, the diversity of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) it has, and having high firepower.

All these combined, the Imperator can be used as a multi-role ship like other [Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships).

## Appearance

The Imperator is one of the largest [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) in the game, being as large as most [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). Its most prominent features are its large bridge window and its two large, angled arms lined with turrets, as well as a central rounded region from which there are spinal barrels, though these shoot no spinals at all. The ship has a futuristic gray and neon styling theme, which is seen in other ships like the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) or the [Kraken]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken).

The Interior of the **Imperator** starts with a hallway that has the [Osiris Legion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris-Legion) flag on each side of the wall, leading up to the pilot cabin, which there is a large screen that displays the text "<span style="color:#aef2fe">**Imperator**</span>".

## Advantages

- Highest health of any current [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Relatively high turn-speed for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Great for PvP and [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) support.
- Great firepower and versatility from its 9 [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 4 [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) Barrels.
- The [Auto-Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) provide good defense from smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Has 200 Shield & Hull DPS, giving it a total of 313 DPS, which is higher than most [Build Menu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) ships.

## Disadvantages

- Very large, practically [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)-sized.
- Has two blind spots, one in the very front in between the arms, and another one behind the ship.
- Thick profile and top-mounted [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) make it hard to shoot ships that move below you.
- Low range and accuracy for many of its weapons.
- Somewhat weak to Shield Breakers as it has mainly [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields)-based health.
- Despite it having the high health, it still can be fragile due to being a slow and easy to hit target.
- [Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) ship on a limited rotation, meaning it will be expensive and cannot be reobtained until it is back in rotation.

## Strategy

- - This ship is best used in a fleet, as providing cover for it can make it maximize it's potential, and lessens the chance of getting [dived]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang).
- Despite some difficulty, it can defend against small ships, however it is best used against larger ships.
- The Imperator can easily destroy low-tier [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), making it a great ship against [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) in a fleet if you can manage to stay in their blind spots.
- Use this ship to chase down crippled [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), as it has high hull damage output.
- The Imperator is fit for pirating, and is pretty good at it too.
- Avoid using it to tank too much damage, as its status as a target makes it a priority to destroy over other ships.
- Use it as a replacement for a Dreadnought if three are already spawned or you do not have enough [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty).
