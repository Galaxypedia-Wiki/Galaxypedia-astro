{{< notices/vipShip >}}

The **_Panther_** is a highly-maneuverable VIP [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Description

The **Panther** is a uniquely-shaped [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) with high top speed, maneuverability, and [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower. It is comparable to the [Sentaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz), but with more [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower and more health. The shape of the **Panther** roughly resembles its namesake.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Panther** is very similar to that of the [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon), with a small detailed room containing the teleporter and pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Ludicrous [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) dps.
- Decent [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.

<!-- -->

- Very high mobility.
- A great support ship if you put it with a large fleet, as it can be a huge source of damage.
- Fast for its class, faster than most Battlecruisers.
- Great acceleration for its class.
- Extremely high overall DPS, higher than some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) at a whopping **261 DPS** (Spinal) **150 DPS** (Turret)**.**

## Disadvantages

- Very expensive and requires VIP.
- Very low health for it's class.
- Vulnerable bottom.
- Due to its fairly large size it can easily be hit by spinals.
- Can be hard to aim spinals due to the odd front section.
- Interior as of .76b24 can bug the camera resulting in the loss of this ship if it's low on health and is dived by players or NPCs

## Strategy

- Make sure to put your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to use as they are quite powerful in battle.
- Due to its high speed and relatively high general durability, diving a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) is a relatively easy task, however, it's not completely immune to damage.
- It can be used to protect bigger ships from [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), using its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), or from bigger ships, using it's [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- You are going to have to rely on range if you are traveling alone.
- Situational awareness is highly relied on when using the **Panther**. A tiny ship sneaking up on you could be your end.
- If you know that there is no escape nuke yourself and you have the slight chance of taking something with you
- The **Panther** has a play style similar to the [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios), as both are glass cannons, extremely maneuverable, and can do huge amounts of damage.
