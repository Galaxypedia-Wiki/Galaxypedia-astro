The **_Beta Warlock_** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) added during the [2021 Retro Ship Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}retro-ship-event-2021)

## Description

The **Beta Warlock** is a turret-focused Battleship that uses an older model of the [Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock). It features a prominent circular ring of four thrusters, a feature characteristic of the older models of the Warlock. Its "Beta" name refers to the use of a slightly newer model, as the original Warlock model was more angular and blocky compared to the one used by this ship.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Beta Warlock** is very long and narrow, requiring walking half the ship to get to the driver's seat, and the other half to get to the end. Upon entering the ship, there is a long hall way with crates lining it. It has text that says "Retro Warlock" on the top middle of the ship despite being named Beta Warlock.

## Advantages

- Has very high turret dps combined with large cannon spinals.
- Retro Medium Railguns give it a maximum range of 7125.

## Disadvantages

- High shield health and low hull health make it vulnerable to shield shredders such as [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) and [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius).
- Turret placement on the top of the ship gives it a big blindspot on the bottom, but this is only a minor vulnerability due to the high turnspeed and acceleration of the ship.
- The ring makes it difficult for turrets to fire, especially at around 5k range.
- Mostly hull armament makes it less effective against shield tanks such as [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement), [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris), and [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator).
- Expensive for its class.

## Strategy

- Stay under and around 3k away from whatever you're firing at, making sure to fire your large cannons every now and then.
- This battleship can easily take down other battleships and even some dreads due to its superior maneuverability and damage.
- Only use it if backed up by people you 100% trust.

## Version History

- Explosion size 100 ----> 470 .75a12

## Trivia

- Is the only ship along with the Mini Beta Behemoth and Mini Beta Andromeda (as of the 2021 Retro Event) to have the "Beta" pronoun in its name.
