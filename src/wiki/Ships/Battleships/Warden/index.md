{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Warden_** is a cheap, agile PvP **[Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)** with an emphasis on shield damage.

## Description

The **Warden** is a shield-breaker counterpart to the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight), and has many similarities to its counterpart aside of the health type it excels at countering.

## Appearance

The **Warden** has a fairly interesting interior containing a teleport pad to the interior where there is control panels to the left and right of the interior, there is also a chair in the middle.

## Advantages

- Incredible efficiency at destroying [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), being better than the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) and (barely) the [Retro Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Aegis) at shield breaking.
- Second cheapest Battleship, behind [Prowler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prowler) by 600 credits (Although it is a [warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}warehouse) level higher).
- Balanced [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets).
- Cheaper than it's [hull breaking counterpart.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight)

## Disadvantages

- Target needs to be a little above for all turrets to fire.
- Somewhat mediocre [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health, although it is enough to be sufficient for tanking kinetic weaponry for a while.
- Blind spot underneath.
- Mediocre [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage output, although it is better than the [Prowler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prowler).
- Requires good spinal aim, as over a vast majority of the [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage output comes from them.

## Strategy

- Extremely good at defending [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase); the low cost makes it less likely to be focused by a fleet, and the shield shredding properties will quickly scare any attackers into retreating.
- Use this ship to counter Cruisers, Battlecruisers, Battleships, or Dreadnoughts. It won't do well against ships much larger than itself or extremely agile ships.

## Version History

- Buffed in .66b, having its shield go from 4000 to 2750 and its hull going from 2000 to 4150, as well as its light gatling laser being changed to a Medium Flak Cannon.
- 2 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and 1 [Triple Heavy Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) removed and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) reduced to 3150 in version .69a1.
- Explosion Size 45 ----> 270 .75a12

## Trivia

- The **Warden** is supposed to be the [Hawklight's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) shield-breaker counterpart.
- Somewhat better than the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) if used correctly.
- The **Warden** has the same mobility as the hawklight, as well as the exact opposite weapon loadout and shield/hull.
