{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Preos Juvenile_** is the third Preos ship in the [Preos Egg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Preos-Egg)'s evolution questline.

## Description

The **_Preos Juvenile_** is a battleship that is the evolution of the [Preos Hatchling]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Preos-Hatchling). It is significantly larger than the previous two Preos ships, and is the first ship to have Amalgam turrets.

## Interior

The interior is identical to the interiors of the previous Preos ships: a purple sphere with a holographic teleporter and seat.

## Advantages

- High overall healthpool.
- Combined damage-per-second of 438, higher than most battleships.
- High speed.
- Small profile for a battleship.
- Large cargo hold for its class.

## Disadvantages

- Inaccurate turrets.
- Large target for spinals.
- Horrible spinal placement, rendering them almost useless.
- Very lopsided healthpool.
- Limited, making it a target for pirates.

## Strategy

- Use this as parts of fleets, for attacking large, slow ships, so you can easily hit your turret and spinal volleys.
- Use your speed to your advantage in battle.
- Avoid hull-shredders such as the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker), as they can annihilate you with their turrets.

## Version History

- Explosion size 100 ----> 400 .75a12
- Removed in version .75a37

## Trivia

- The first person to lose this ship was Polar_Maverick, to a [Lament]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lament).
