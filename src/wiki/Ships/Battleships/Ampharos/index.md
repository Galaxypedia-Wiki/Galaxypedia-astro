The **_Ampharos_** is a [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) great for defending heavy [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) ships during a siege.

## Description

The **Ampharos** is a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that consists of a large spine with small wings.

The **Ampharos** is great for defending heavy [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) ships during a siege along with defending a base against small [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) trying to distract the base's [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) by using its [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) to shred the small ships.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Ampharos** is very simple. You enter the ship through a teleporter located at the top and get sent into a small room containing a pilot seat.

## Advantages

- Absolutely shreds small [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) (although it is slightly more difficult to destroy more powerful ones like the [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen) and [Nightmare]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nightmare)).
- High mobility.
- Decent [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Powerful [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Extremely good at fleet support.
- 4th fastest [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) in the game, right behind the [Witch]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Witch).
- Decent Interior if you care about that.
- Great for taking down aliens.
- A great ship for wrecking the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight)
- The thin, vertical shape of this ship makes dodging spinals and turret fire much easier.
- Faster and better spinals than its AA counterpart, the [Loyalist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalist)

## Disadvantages

- Weak against other [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Can't siege due to the lack of [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and Heavy Weaponry.
- Easier to hit from the sides as it appears bigger at that angle, making it susceptible to broadside ships such as [Genesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Genesis) or [Behemoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Behemoth).
- Less firepower than the **Ampharos's** ,The [Loyalist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalist), which makes the **Ampharos** a worse choice when fighting other [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)

## Strategy

- It's close range rapid-fire armament makes it ideal for fighting small, fast [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships), such as the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).
- Having multiple **Ampharos**' alongside [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) (above, sides, and bottom) can be the difference in victory or defeat, as the [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) can focus completely on the base or other threats while you deal with the smaller [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- It is a good ship for pirating or escort, however, it is not as mobile as other combat ships such as [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) or [Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grievion).
- Don't try to attack a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), as you are a giant target and will quickly get shredded by the [Large Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Try to get under the ship you are attacking, as your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) all fire upwards. That way, you can get the most damage out as possible.
- When attacking a [Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx), the **Ampharos** is incredible as it can destroy [Nixesions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) with ease, but be careful because you will be killed very quickly if the fighters are targeting you.
- This ship should be used in a siege to protect larger ships from [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) and [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) but never attack the starbase/planet directly.
- In a pinch, it's fast speed to be used to distract heavy starbase turrets during a siege, but be mindful of your shield and hull while doing this.
- You could wreck a [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) if you're experienced, fire from the bottom of the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight).

## Version History

- The model of the ship was remade in update .53 for unknown reasons.
- Changed in .63h to have nearly 1000 more health in each stat, replace the [Light Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) with dual [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and increased the price.
- Max Shield increased to 3350 from 3150 in .65b
- Medium Lasers replaced with Point Defense Lasers in version .66b
- Remodeled in version .66b, as well as receiving buffs, with its hull going from 2750 to 3250, its two Point Defense Lasers becoming two Heavy Point Defense Lasers, and it 2 Dual Medium Cannons becoming 2 Medium Flak Cannons.

## Trivia

- On the lower bridge, there is a table with a 3D image of the old [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).
- This ship has the exact same name as Ampharos from the Pokémon series.
- One of the five ships chosen to be remodeled as a Halloween ship, this one being the [Bone Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bone-Ampharos) or "Flying Skelly"
- Mostly called "amp" or "amph" in game
- Featured many times on Sean Morabito's old YouTube videos.
- When remodeled in .66b, it received an ungodly explosion damage of 7k to shields. This was used to destroy many dreadnoughts before it was patched. These fallen dreadnoughts are still on display in the refund-request channel of the Galaxy Discord Server.
- Its latest model made it the first vertically oriented battleship, following on the steps of the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream), the first of all vertical [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) in Galaxy.
- Because of the similarities with the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream), the Ampharos is sometimes called the "Baby Slip"
