The **_Snowfall_** is a powerful [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) released from the 1st stage of the [2019 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2019).

## Description

The **Snowfall** is a winter-themed [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that has focus on [Broadside]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology)-firepower.

This [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) focuses on [Broadside]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology)-firepower and excels at being a flagship in a fleet due to the diversity of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) it has and having a high health for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships). It's firepower leans more on shredding [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) due to it's 10 Medium Phasers.

The Snowfall has a [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) "Cryogenic Counter", this slows down all enemies by 20% that are in a 5k stud range of the module.

## Appearance

The Snowfall is a long [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) with most of it's materials being made of snow. There are spiky ice ornaments decorated all around the ships, including 5 Spinal Barrels on each side of the ship.

The Interior is snow-covered box, containing a yellow-teleporter door and the pilot seat.

## Advantages

- Diversity of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) gives it accuracy and the ability to hit small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- High turn-speed and acceleration for a [Battleship.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)
- Has the ability to shred [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) at a [Shield DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) of 379.
- Great [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) for a [Battleship.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)
- Excels at broadside combat.
- Has a module that can slow down enemies in a 5k stud radius.

## Disadvantages

- Expensive for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and will be hunted for being a [Limited Ship.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)
- Broadside Spinals can be difficult to get used to.
- Has low [Hull DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) compared to Shield.
- [Unbalanced]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) Shield Health compared to Hull, making it vulnerable against Hull-Breakers.
- The total health does not reflect well on the total price, especially for a [Battleship.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships)

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.
- Always face the side of your ship to the enemy to maximize damage output, especially its Spinals.
- Focus on shield tank ships such as the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis), or [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement) as the ship outputs high [Shield DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology).
- When one [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) is reloading, fire the other [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) while turning your ship with your fast turnspeed.
- Avoid Hull-Breakers such as the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker), or [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) due to your unbalanced health.
- Remember to use [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), as they account for 60% of this ships' total DPS.
- Also remember to use your module (B) when the enemy is in close range to slow then down and take them down.
