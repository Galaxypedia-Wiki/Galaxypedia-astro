_This article describes the NPC ship. For the player-owned equivalent, see [Sovereign]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sovereign)._

The **Sovereign-X** is an [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Description

The **Sovereign-X** is a passive, [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) affiliated ship that is the equivalent of a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and has high DPS for its class.

This ship almost never loses a fight because of its 'call' ability, where it calls all UNE ships around the map to its target. A swarm of these can take down a [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator), or a Level 5 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) (if they could attack starbases).

## Behavior

The **Sovereign-X** is seen guarding the U.N.E. Starbase, and the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) in the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event). It will leave it's guarding post to respond to other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships' call for aid. Once the target is destroyed, it will return to the Starbase it is guarding.

It is able to call other U.N.E. ships to assist it in combat, similar to a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher).

**Note**: The Sovereign-X, along with other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships, do not spawn in private servers.

## Strategy

- Lure powerful enemy AI ships such as a [Galleon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galleon) or [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) to it, if engaged, it will call other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ships around the map to attack it.

## Version History

- Released in version.69.
- Rearmed and Buffed in Version .70a8
- Spawned naturally along with other [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) capital ships during the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event) in version .75a10.
- Disabled from spawning naturally due to the conclusion of the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event) in version .75a11.

## Trivia

- Second [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ship added in Galaxy.
- Same as the [Sovereign]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sovereign), it has the exact same description as the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight).
- The Sovereign-X has a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) icon in-game, but it is actually classed as a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
