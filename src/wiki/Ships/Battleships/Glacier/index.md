The **_Glacier_** is a [**Limited**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) remodel of the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis).

## Description

The **Glacier** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ship made for the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event 2017</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017). It was originally a reskin of the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis), with 500 less [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 800 more [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).

## Appearance

The old **Glacier** had an interior that was exactly identical to the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis). The **Glacier's** newest remodel has drastically reduced the amount of interior the ship had originally.

## Advantages

- High [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- High [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Highest acceleration of any [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) deal great damage.
- Large Cargo Hold for its class.

## Disadvantages

- Low hull.
- Vulnerable top.
- Very expensive for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- No longer being sold. If you lose this ship, it's gone.

## Strategy

- While many of the strategies for the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis) apply to this ship, its increased health makes it much more effective for tanking [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)-breakers .
- Beware of [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields)-shredders, as your formidable health pool is reduced to nothing in a matter of seconds when up against one of these, such as the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus).
- This is a great chaser, as the 8 [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are quite useful in destroying hulled ships.

## Version History

- Added in .60.
- Received a major buff and slight nerf in .60d that reduced [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) by 200 and buffed [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) by 1200.
- Remodeled in .61h1?
- Hull increased from 1500 to 3500, Speed increased from 60 to 100, Medium Railguns replaced with Crystal railguns in version .68e
- Explosion size 300 ----> 560 .75a12

## Trivia

- The **Glacier** costs exactly double the amount of the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis).
- Highest [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) of any [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- For a limited amount of time after the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event 2017</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017), the ship was able to be built for nearly half of its original value (the reason for this is still unknown).
- Was not able to spawn onto servers after a _very long_ remodeling process, this issue has since been resolved.
- Between the **Glacier** and its normal buildable counterpart, the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis) Battleship, the **Glacier** exceeds in health by 2000 (although it has 800 less [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 2800 more [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)), Top Speed by 20, Acceleration by 5, Turn Speed by 0.05, loses 1 [Heavy Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) for 2 [Light Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), loses 2 [Medium Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), loses 2 [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) (turret) for 2 [Medium Crystal Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and contains 2 extra [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) (spinal).
- The second most expensive battleship in game.
- The total health of this ship is the same as [Plagued Warship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Warship) but with the [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) reversed.
- Was released again in the new "Limited Edition (Permits)" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a D class permit (675k credits) + 5281 Sillicate, 3903 Carbon, 2882 Iridium, 442Adamantite, 751 Palladium, 498 Titanium, 498 Quantium, and 51 Uranium.
