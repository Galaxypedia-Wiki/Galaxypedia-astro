The Helios is a powerful and extremely fast [Battleship.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)

## Description

The **Helios** is a swift and hard hitting [Battleship.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)

This ship excels at providing firepower support in fleets and [Diving]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) Ships with it's high firepower. It is able to effectively evade fire and dish out extreme damage with it's speed and agility in most situations. All these combined, the Helios can be used as a multi-role ship like other [Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships).

## Appearance

The Helios has an extremely flat and [Avian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}<wikipedia:Crane-(bird)> "wikilink") shape with wing shapes resembling that of a Crane's. On the front of it can be seen it's main spinal barrel. It has 2 long forks extending out of its 2 main wings. Both edges of the main wing change their color depending on the team's color.

The Interior is a black room with a pilot seat and a teleporter leading outside.

## Advantages

- Very high damage output with its advanced [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), being higher than most [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Fast and flat, allowing for easier dodging and reduced damage when [Drifting]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting).
- Insanely fast and agile for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), having a top speed of and Turn Speed.
- Large Cargo Hold for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- One of the few ships with 100% [Drift]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting) Percentage.
- Speed, Maneuverability, and Firepower all make up for the Helios' lack of hull integrity.
- Massive Shield and Hull damage, equal to the [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius) and the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker).

## Disadvantages

- Extremely low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Weaker against, and capable of being easily destroyed by shield shredding targets.
- When the **Helios** is not in rotation, you cannot get it again after you lose it until the next rotation. (potentially no longer an issue due to changes in advanced ship mechanics)
- Expensive cost and [Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) classification makes for a high priority target.
- Large [blindspot]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) underneath the ship.

## Strategy

- Use your high mobility to out maneuver most [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) and obliterate [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) with ease.
- Drift to minimize the damage you receive using your 100% [Drifting]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting) Percentage.
- Don't attack large fleets that can shoot accurately enough to counter your speed.
- Always try to hit your spinals, they account for a large portion of your DPS.
- Act as an extra pile of guns and not a flagship. The Helios can do tremendous amounts of damage, but being targeted greatly increases your chances of being destroyed.
- This ship is good for [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) bigger [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) and [Freighters.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)
- Avoid going too close to a Capital Ship, as you will have a hard time hitting your Spinals and their Turrets will shred you.
- Avoid Shield Breakers such as the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus), as they will break your [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and destroy you easily.
- [Warp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) away as soon as you can BEFORE you get your [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) destroyed because of your extremely low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Be wary when attacking ships larger than [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) as their powerful weaponry could easily tear you apart.
- A powerful counter to small siege fleets, as most siege ships have very inaccurate [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Warp into fights later, your low health and high hull damage make it a better option for survival and kill stealing.
- Effective against pirates due to the high speed, high hull damage, flat shape, and shield based health.
- Like other [Advanced Ships,]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) it is extremely effective in swarms. Gather a few more of this ship for extremely devastating DPS capable of quickly destroying almost any normal ship.
- Against fleets, you have a very good chance of being targeted because other players will see you as an advanced [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) kill. This could result you being dived even after taking little damage.
