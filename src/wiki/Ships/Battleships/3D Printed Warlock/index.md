The **_3D Printed Warlock_** is a unique reskin of the **[Battleship-Class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)** ship "[Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock)."

## Description

The **3D Printed Warlock** is a reskin of the [Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock). The ship is armed with its own special [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) called [3D Printed Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [3D Printed Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). The ship is the same as the regular [Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock) except that it is all white to represent 3D printer plastic.

## Appearance

There is a small teleporter pad that leads to a hallway stretching nearly the entire length of the ship. The hallway has three wider openings with a set of three windows on each side of the openings. The middle opening contains one large pilot's seat and a faction-colored neon screen.

## Advantages

- Its a ship many don't know about giving an element of surprise.
- It has an insanely long-ranged [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Custom [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) with massive damage.
- It has high maneuverability for a Battleship.
- Same speed as most [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) allowing it to outmaneuver a lot of [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and smaller ships.
- It has a very small blind spot.

## Disadvantages

- You must buy something from the [Galaxy 3D Store](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/galaxy-store).
- More likely to be targeted due to siege capabilities.
- Is a high priority target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating), and if you lose this ship, **YOU CANNOT GET IT BACK!**
- Very white, making it easier for enemies to see it and aim their [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals).
- Small Cargo Hold, making it easier for vultures to steal your loot after you siege.

## Strategy

- Use your insane range and damage to siege bases.
- Great [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement, damage, and range allow for easy destruction of smaller ships, although exercise caution when fighting [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- **DO NOT** use as an everyday ship for battling as you might lose it.
- During a battle, try to keep your distance.

## Version History

- Received a class promotion and health nerf in .65b2? that advanced the ship to the [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) class but lowered [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) to 4750 each. Later, its class was returned to Battleship again.
- Remodeled in version .66k.
- 3 [Large Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) changed to huge variantsÂ in version .69a2.
- Spinal Large Cannon count increased from 3 to 5 in version .72e1.
- Explosion size 90 ----> 510 .75a12

## Trivia

- The first ship to have its own [Railgun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) sounds.
- Designed after the actual **3D Warlock Model** on the [Galaxy 3D store](https://www.shapeways.com/shops/galaxy-store).
- DJFancehFeast was the first person to lose this ship in combat. It was lost during a skirmish between the Galaxy Factions called [The Holy Kryuvian Empire]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Holy-Kryuvian-Empire), De Nexus Empire, and [The Cultists]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Cultists).
- Was accidentally released for around 50k credits on March 28, 2020. It was found during a mining run the Blackhawks were doing in a vip server. At least 35 **3D Printed Warlocks** were bought in this vip server.
- Was unintentionally released again for around 200k credits on July 7, 2021. It is unknown how many were purchased.
