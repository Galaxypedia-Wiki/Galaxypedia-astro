_This article describes the player vessel. To see the NPC counterpart, see [Hearteater]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hearteater)._ The **Widowmaker** is a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) released on February 14th, 2022; during the Valentine's Day 2022 Event.

## Description

The **Widowmaker** is a player variant of the [Hearteater]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hearteater).

## Appearance

## Advantages

- Low range.

## Strategy

- Use in a fleet, as a [ Support Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}support-ships).
- This ship will likely be focused by competent players, due to its [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) status.
- This ship is not great for AA duty, as four of its turrets are PDLs with terrible accuracy.
