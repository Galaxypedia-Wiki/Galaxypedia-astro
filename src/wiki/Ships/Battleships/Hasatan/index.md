{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Hasatan_** is a torpedo-armed [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and _was_ the first ship to have a [Large Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Description

The **Hasatan** has a thin front that expands to a set of blast wings and wider thrusters on the rear.

It has a Torpedo tube-like decoration that houses a [Large Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).

## Appearance

The entrance has a teleporter that teleports the player to the pilot room which has three seats. The seat on the back is the pilot seat.

## Advantages

- Relatively low cost.
- Good health pool.
- High damage per shot and long range(11,000 studs) with the [Large Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), at 750 damage.
- Great overall [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- Decent long-range [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) armament.
- Overall good damage output.

## Disadvantages

- Long [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) reloading time.
- A large target that is easily hit by [Large Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- The extremely slow speed of the [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) makes fighting almost impossible, short of [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and large [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- Underwhelming maneuverability for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Ineffective against smaller, faster [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Relies on the [Super LR Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and the [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) for [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.

## Strategy

- It is an excellent alternative to conventional [Siege Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}siege-ships), being cheaper and also capable of dealing high damage to bases from a long range.
- Be sure to get far enough from the base because the health is too low to tank for more than 30 seconds.
- Use [PVP ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}pvp-ships) as escorts, along with another **Hasatan** for constant assault.
- Try to get away if any ships come towards you. A [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) can even kill you if you have no support.
- Very effective with the "[Outside The Box]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies)" tactic.
- Can be good against [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) if it's constantly on its blind spots. However, it's bad against any ships smaller or faster than a Battleship.

## Version History

- Remodeled in version .61d.
- Received a buff in .66b increasing its [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) from 2500 to 3000, its [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) from 2000 to 3000, increasing the [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) size from large to huge, and revamping the [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) loadout. It was also remodeled.
- 1 [Long Range Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 3 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) removed in version .69a1.
- 2 [Long Range Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replaced with 2 [Medium Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .69e, due to Long Range Laser (not the Heavy LR Laser) turret being removed from the game.
- 1 [Huge Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) downsized to large variant in version .71b.
- 2 Medium Phasers upgraded to 2 Large Phasers in unknown version.
- Shield health increased from 3,300 to 4,300, 1 Heavy LR Laser replaced with 1 Super LR Laser, and 2 Medium Railguns replaced with 2 Medium Siege Railguns in version .75a5.
- Explosion size 60 ----> 275 .75a12

## Trivia

- In theory, it can kill a base without the base ever firing back. In practice, though, unless it is guarded, it will die easily to enemy defenders.
- It used to have a glitch with one of its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), resulting in a [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) that is inside the ship.
- The [Large Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry)Â does high damage, so it's a very popular ship for [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging).
- The first **Hasatan** model heavily resembled a CR-90 Corvette from Star Wars.
- Somewhat Resembles the [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia).
  - The interior and back resemble the [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon).
