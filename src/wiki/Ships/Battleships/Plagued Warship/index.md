The **_Plagued Warship_** is a [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that was introduced in the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019). It was formerly the [Genesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Genesis)'s limited counterpart before its remodel.

## Description

The **Plagued Warship** is a [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019) Battleship. It is well-known for its extreme average damage output, being able to outdamage many [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Appearance

The interior is a detailed box, with a nice seat and a display in front of it. The display says "29~##024aA4 SYTEM STATUS: BETTER THAN EVER 0Km(4##\_-pR".

## Advantages

- Insane overall damage output of 357; it has the highest average DPS out of all Battleships if not taking into account the [Revylation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revylation-ü¶ç) and [Snowfall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowfall), both being ships that cannot fully utilize their total DPS in most combat situations.
- Great mobility statistics, with a fast turn speed of '}}.
- Fairly high total health pool.

## Disadvantages

- Must be pointing the ship towards the enemy for all of the turrets to have a line of sight.
- Has little long range weaponry.
- Must have good spinal aim to use ship this effectively, as its spinals make up for almost half of its damage output.
- It is a prime target due to its limited status and strength.
- May struggle against smaller ships.

## Strategy

- Use your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), as they provide massive output DPS and will obliterate the opponent's [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), then you can rely more on the [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and Cannons to finish the target off.
- Get in the ship's weak spot and focus with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Version History

- Medium Cannon spinal barrel count increased from 4 to 5, Quad Advanced Medium Cannons' positions shifted such that the turrets are "orbital" in version .72d.
- Explosion size 80 ----> 600 .75a12

## Trivia

- The first player to lose one was SCRAPPIE_1, destroyed by GrumpyMadPlayer's [Atlas]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Atlas).
- It resembles the old [Genesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Genesis) model, and shares most attributes except for the "tentacles," as well as the spinal weaponry, it also resembles the current [Katana]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Katana) model.
  - It actually came out before the old [Genesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Genesis) model and the current [Katana]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Katana) model.
- It was the only [battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) introduced in the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019).
- The total health of this ship is the same as [Glacier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Glacier) but with the [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) reversed.
