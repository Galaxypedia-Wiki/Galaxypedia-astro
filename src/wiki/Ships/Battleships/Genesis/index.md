{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Genesis_** is a heavily armed PvP/Support [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) With unique broadside spinals.

## Description

The **Genesis** is a balanced [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) with fair mobility and powerful weapons, making it great in combat with ships of its class. The only notable blindspot the **Genesis** has is at the rear. The ship itself is rather long with turrets placed along the top and bottom. Team-colored plating covers much of the top side, with various darker grey/black parts accenting the brighter colors.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Genesis **is a simple room with a blue panel sitting in front of the Pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Good turn speed for a Battleship.
- Has easily redeemable blind spots, making it difficult to get an edge against it in battle.
- Balanced health.
- A good variety of turrets.

## Disadvantages

- Relatively low top speed compared to other [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Vulnerable backside.
- Somewhat weak against [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Falls to larger, more powerful ships such [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Weak explosion damage for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Broadside [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) can be hard to hit, unless you're experienced.
- Very weak against most ships without the spinals.
- Can be easily destroyed by even [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) in many situations.

## Strategy

- One of the best [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) for [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating), as its turret firepower can destroy [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) before they can escape.
- Use multiple Genesis' in a fleet to supply overwhelming turret firepower, even against [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- If possible, make use of the Spinal weapons, as they are very powerful and can do a lot of [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage quickly.
- Front-facing or broadside-facing angles may be most effective to maximize turret lines of sight.

## Version History

- Suspended temporarily for lag reduction tests.
- Was unsuspended in version ???
- Received two broadside [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in .65a5?
- Light Laser replaced with Light Gatling Laser, Dual Medium Laser replaced with Point Defense Laser in version .66b.
- Remodeled and buffed in version .66b---Shield increased from 3250 to 3750, Hull from 3000 to 4000, single Large Phaser replaced with 8 Medium Phasers, and turret loadout completely reworked.
- Received a placeholder remodel and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) reduced from 8 broadside [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to 4 frontal [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in version .67c.
- 1 [Medium Phaser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and 1 [Triple Heavy Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) removed, [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) reduced to 3000 and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) reduced to 3100 in version .69a1.

## Trivia

- It used to be very weak with only one [Heavy Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), but after the [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) rebalances in .???, the **Genesis** became a deadly adversary not to be underestimated.
- Before the temporary suspension of this ship, it caused massive amounts of lag while spawned in.
- The **Genesis** was once one of the most widely used [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) in Galaxy, and is again very common in fleet battles in multiple servers.
- One of its models was shared with the [Behemoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Behemoth), a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that plays a PvP/Support role like the **Genesis**
- Due to its old model being drawn from the [Plagued Warship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Warship), the ship was nicknamed the "Unplagued Warship" by players.
- Used to have a frontal teleporter, which allowed you to jump-despawn easily, but that was removed in the current remodel.
- Lost almost 2000 total health when it was nerfed, in addition to very powerful turrets. This caused many players to move towards other meta ships, although the **Genesis**is still a very formidable ship.
- The current [Katana]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Katana) model is the **Genesis's** old model.
