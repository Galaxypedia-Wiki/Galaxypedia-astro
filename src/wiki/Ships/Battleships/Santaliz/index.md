## Description

## Appearance

## Advantages

- High mobility.
- Powerful [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals) armament.
- Good amount of health for its speed, higher total health than it's [normal counterpart]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz)
- Does not require [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass), unlike its [normal counterpart]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz).

## Disadvantages

- Bad [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement and low firepower.
- Expensive; costs as much as a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Spinal barrels are spread out, making hitting smaller targets more challenging.
- Lower acceleration and no torpedoes unlike its normal counterpart.

## Strategy

- Warp out of combat if your shield health is low. Most people will try to dive it if they see it hulled.
- Do not overestimate its speed, It is not very strong on its own. It can easily be destroyed by a skilled team.
- Use this as you would use a [Hallow]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hallow).
