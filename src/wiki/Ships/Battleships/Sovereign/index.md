{{< shipInfobox >}}

_This Article describes the player-owned vessel. For the identical NPC ship, see [Sovereign-X]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sovereign-X)._

The **_Sovereign_** is a **[Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)** with powerful [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and high health.

## Description

The **Sovereign** features an array of different [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and balanced stats for taking on a variety of ships. Its low maneuverability means it can be exploited by certain blind spots, making it heavily recommended that players be cautious while using this.

## Appearance

The interior is a small but detailed box containing the pilot seat and a couple of screens.

## Advantages

- Cheap cost compared to other battleships.
- Versatile mix of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Great healthpool, one of the highest for battleships.
- Has a balance between spinal and turret firepower.

## Disadvantages

- Tied with the [Archeon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archeon) and [Genesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Genesis) as the second slowest battleship in the game (top speed).
- Vulnerable bottom.
- Must be facing completely towards the target to use all turrets and spinals due to line-of-sight issues with turrets
- Despite having a [Larger Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) class than the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight), the [Hawklight's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) do more damage.
- Turrets are not effective against smaller, faster ships.
- Low maneuverability combined with no light turrets means the **Sovereign** is awful against anything under a Battlecruiser, and even struggles against some Battlecruisers. Yet the **Sovereign** still gets outgunned by Dreadnoughts, so this puts the **Sovereign** in this spot where it does not counter many things, except for a select few Battleships and Battlecruisers.

## Strategy

- Be careful if an agile ship attacks you, as it may be able to outmaneuver your ship.
- If possible, stick to fleets. More often than not your additional firepower will help to destroy enemy fleets and bases.
- Avoid ships that are both versatile and deal heavy damage, such as the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan) or [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).

## Version History

- Buffed in version .63a?
- Remodeled in an unknown version.
- Remodeled again in version .66b, and was also buffed, with its shield increasing from 3500 to 4050, it hull from 3000 to 3350, its large cannon spinal becoming 2 large cannons, its 3 light turrets and Medium LaserÂ were removed, being replaced by a Dual Medium Cannon and a Triple Heavy Cannon. Its cargo hold also increased from 250 to 253 as well as its acceleration increasing from 19 to 23.
- [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) reduced to 3700 in version .69a1.
- Explosion size 60 ----> 275 .75a12

## Trivia

- Decent first battleship---its durability allows even inexperienced players escape bad situations.
- The remodeled version was originally meant to be an [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) remodel.
- Used to be seen as weak by a lot of players.
