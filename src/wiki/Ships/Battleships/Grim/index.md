The **_Grim_** is a unique **[Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)**that was obtained by completing the Event Quest "[Death Incarnate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Death-Incarnate)."

## Description 

The**Grim** is a [Battleship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) that was added during the[<span style="color:#ff7500">Halloween Event (2018)</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018). Players had to complete the quest [Death Incarnate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Death-Incarnate) to obtain it. The **Grim** is armed with 4 Grim Railguns.

## Interior 

A teleporter just on the outside leads you straight to the cockpit. The pilot's seat is inside the orb.

## Advantages 

- It is one of the fastest ships in its class.
- Its health pool is higher than all [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), and even some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), too.
- Insanely powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Extremely high DPS for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Disadvantages 

- Easily swarmed by small ships if the pilot is not skilled enough.
- Pirates and other fleets may target this ship as a trophy kill.
- Must be good at aiming spinals since it makes up the majority of the DPS.
- The most expensive battleship in the game (but only because of the Class B Permit).

## Version History 

- 4 Skull Turrets replaced with 2 [Advanced Medium Autocannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Advanced Medium Autolasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in an unknown version.
- [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) reduced from 6666 to 3333, 8 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) changed to 8 [Large Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and 4 [Large Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) changed to 4 [Huge Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in version .68d.
- Added to the limited build menu in version .73a?, requiring a Class B Permit and regular materials.
- 2 Medium Advanced Autocannons and 2 Medium Advanced Autolasers replaced with 4 Grim Railguns in version .73b8.
- Explosion size 120 ----> 600 .75a12

## Strategy

- Best used as a support ship in sieges, or as a finisher ship on lighter targets.
- Great against other [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnought) since it can outmaneuver them while inflicting high Spinal damage.
- Always bring a fleet to cover your ship as it is a high priority target due to its value and rarity.

## Trivia

- Due to duplication glitches (and other issues never fully revealed), the quest to obtain the **Grim** was taken down before the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018) ended.
- The first person to build a **Grim** was HK4l7.
