{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Archeon_** is a [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) class ship designed specifically for sieging [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).

_Not to be confused with the [Atheon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Atheon)._

## Description

The **Archeon** is a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that specializes in destroying the [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) of large, slow targets such as enemy Planets and [Starbases.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) It can be very slow and is unable to defend itself from small [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships), especially ones that can outmaneuver its [Railgun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) volleys.

## Interior

The interior of the Archeon consists of a small but detailed box with 4 chairs on the side, and a recliner at the front that serves as a pilot seat.

## Advantages

- Good health for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), especially in hull.
- Performs very well in fleets.
- Decent turn speed.
- No [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) work involved, making it fairly easy to use.
- Good hull damage.
- Decent at chasing down hulled [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) thanks to the vast array of kinetic weaponry.
- Has one of the highest overall alpha damage statistics of all [Battleships.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable when alone, it is unable to defend itself from most [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Usually cannot perform well in [ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) to [ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) combat scenarios.
- [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) will almost always miss on anything smaller than a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) unless you get really close.
- Rather low [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Large blindspot behind the ship.
- [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) health is rather lacking when compared to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health.
- Very poor overall damage output; being the second lowest among all [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Practically useless for [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) due to the very poor damage output; even though the turret firepower looks good on paper, it cannot outrange [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) so it falls short against even some [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) for effectiveness in sieges.

## Strategy

- A useful tip with the **Archeon** is to approach it at a 45-degree angle from below the base. This will allow you to usually fire upon the base, destroying most of its [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) quickly, without taking damage yourself. Caution is advised when using this tactic, as it does not always work. Again, it is best used if you have a fleet with you in the same location.
- The **Archeon** is a vulnerable ship and can easily be destroyed on its own, hence there should always be an escort. Only take it out during sieges and play smart. Don't let yourself become a target.
- It is best used in fleets, as it is very vulnerable when alone, due to the poor accuracy of [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It should typically not be used to fight other [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships), as its [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) will have a hard time getting through [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), and their low accuracy makes PvP against small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) nearly impossible.
- Having such a high [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage output it is great for finishing off [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), both to help or counter a siege.
- When paired with a [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) breaker, you can decimate anything large and slow.
- Try to stay close to [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos), since they can get rid of small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) for you.

## Trivia

- The **Archeon** is similar in design to the [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) [Argosy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Argosy), from its appearance to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)-destroyer.
- Some people call this a "Mini-[Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker)" because both have bad [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement and are [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) destroyers and siege ships.
- The **Archeon** has "Acheion" spelled on Its upper right engine in Japanese, which is "**Archeon**" mistranslated.![Second

- The **Archeon** originally had a [Heavy Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on the front in Alpha.
- Has similar features to the [Argosy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Argosy).![Archeon
