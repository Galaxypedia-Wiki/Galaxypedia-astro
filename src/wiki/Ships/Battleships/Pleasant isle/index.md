## Description

The **Pleasant Isle** is a limited [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) that was part of the 2022 Easter Event. It is a floating volcanic island with trees, grasses, and bodies of water, said water flowing off the edges in 3 channels.

## Interior

The **Pleasant Isle's** interior resembles that of the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement), a small octagonal room with a pilot's chair and control panel. However, the walls are colored to a stone and dirt color. The monitor on the control panel has a picture of 3 Moai with bunny ears.

## Advantages

- High cargo hold for its class.
- Absolutely shreds small [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) with its PDLs and Flaks.
- Turrets have a high rate of fire.
- Decent maneuverability and speed
- Good hull health.
- ðŸ—¿

## Disadvantages

- Hull-breakers like the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker), [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan), [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) and [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) can easily destroy this ship, or force it to retreat.
- Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.
- Max turret range is very small for a ship its class.
- Volcano can act as an obstruction for the turrets' line of sight.
- Area below the main island is a blindspot that can be abused if the pilot does not use the **Pleasant Isle's** maneuverability to their advantage. (All turrets mounted on the top)

## Strategy

- Treat it like a trophy ship, as it is limited.
- This ship is best suited for [pest control]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archetypes) and [fleet support]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archetypes) if used, as its turrets have a good fire rate, accuracy, and damage output.
- Pitch slightly downwards to overcome the blindspot caused by the Volcano .

## Version History

- Explosion size 100 ----> 400 .75a12

- The turrets resemble the Moai found on Easter island.
- Interior resembles that of the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement), and may be a recolored copy of the Judgement's interior.
- Costed a permit for a time during its event.
