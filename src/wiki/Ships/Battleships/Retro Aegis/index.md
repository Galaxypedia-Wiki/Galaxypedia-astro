The Retro Aegis is the retro version of the [Aegis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aegis), a very powerful shield-shredding Limited [Battleship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).

## Description

The **Retro Aegis** is rather large for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) with two large blast shields at it side wielding amazing shield shredding capabilities.

## Appearance

The **Retro Aegis** starts with a walkway into a large hallway with many windows on both sides along with many rooms and seats at the end along with a ramp going up to the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor is just like the first floor has many windows and a large open hallway leading to the pilot seat and the control consul. The 3rd floor is just a hallway with large windows going across.

## Advantages

- Above average shield health.
- Amazing turn speed.
- High top speed of 80.
- High turret DPS of 272.
- Surprisingly costs less than its non limited counterpart the Aegis coming in at 108,478 credits

## Disadvantages

- Weak hull integrity, which makes it very fragile without shields.
- Due to the turrets only being located at the front, this ship has poor line of sight at the sides and rear of the ship.
- Limited classification, making this a high priority target.
- No kinetic weaponry of any sort, making for very poor damage to hull.

<!-- -->

- <u>Extremely</u> weak to shield breakers, and effectively counters itself.

<!-- -->

- Worse than the Warden in every way.

## Strategy

- Team up with a hullbreaker ship, as your shield-melting armament will help a lot when combined with the kinetic weaponry of another ship.
- **NEVER** attempt to tank in this ship, it does not have the durability to do so. Instead, let a Dreadnought or a battleship with better durability tank instead.
- Much like it's normal counterpart, it's hull is fragile so disengage from a fight before you're hulled(ideally 1k or 1.5k shield HP).
- If you see a shield breaker like the [Warden]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warden) or [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) approaching you, run as fast as you can back to the nearest neutral or friendly starbase.

## Version History

- Added in version .73a3 as part of the 2021 Retro Ship Event.
- Gained teleporters and Shields/Hull increased from 4000/700 to 5000/1500 after the event ended.
- Explosion size 65 ----> 460 .75a12

## Trivia

- This ship is the old version of the Aegis.
- The **Retro** **Aegis** looks similar to the Ankylon Titan from Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion.
