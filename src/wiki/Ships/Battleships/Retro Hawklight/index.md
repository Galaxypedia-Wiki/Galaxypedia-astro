The **_Retro Hawklight_** is a **[limited-edition]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** version of the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) that features its 2nd generation model and armament.

## Description

This limited ship is one of the first models of the widely loved [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight). It features a weapon loadout similar to the original's and proves to be a very strong PVP ship just like its normal counterpart.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Retro Hawklight** is rather mundane; it is composed of a single room with the pilot seat at the front and a very similar looking seat in addition to a blank screen at the back right corner of the area.

## Advantages

- Powerful hull breaking [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Great top speed and maneuverability; higher turn speed and acceleration than even the [Sentaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz).
- Balanced and high health pool for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Versatile [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are able to provide some protection against smaller ships while still doing a good amount of damage, especially towards [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Damage output is much more balanced compared to its regular counterpart.
- Due to its speed, agility and high DPS, it is a great ship for [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).

## Disadvantages

- Relies heavily on its spinals for hull damage.
- Expensive for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- The underside is a weakspot; only 1 Turret is positioned under the ship.

- Slightly problematic turret placement.

## Strategy

- Warp under your opponents as almost all of the turrets are on top of the ship.
- Exploit bigger ships' blindspots with your superior mobility.
- Use this ship's [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) to finish off crippled targets.
- Be careful when using this ship as it will be seen as a valuable target. Avoid extensively tanking damage and retreat if needed.

## Version History

- Added in .66b, along with the [Retro Ship event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}-retro-ship-event-2019).
- Received a buff along with all other retro event ships in .66b shortly after the event ended.

## Trivia

- The first person to lose this ship was StarWarsFany to a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
