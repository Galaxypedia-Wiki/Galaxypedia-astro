The **_Jack-Al'-Lantern_** is a powerful [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020) [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Description

The **Jack-Al'-Lantern** is a recolor of the [Jackal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jackal). The primary change is that it was recolored to be orange. Its Hull, Top Speed, Turn Speed and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are buffed compared to the regular Jackal, while its Shield is slightly lower, but otherwise it does not differ significantly from its counterpart.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Jack-Al'-Lantern** is identical to its counterpart, except that the statues lining the main walkway are replaced with skulls. The Hyperion core is encased in a pumpkin shaped shell. The pilots main cockpit has a green light when docked. However, when in motion the green light flickers creating a lightning effect.

## Advantages

- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Very high maneuverability.
- 2nd fastest [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) in the game, behind [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios).
- Higher health than its [regular counterpart]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jackal).

## Disadvantages

- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Requires good [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) aim.
- Very expensive for a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Relatively low Shield health.
- A limited ship, making those who use it a large target.
- One of the worst limited ships in the event due to the fact that many other ships above 180 speed can outrun it's spinals, and the [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen) is a clear example.
- A swarm of 3 Frigates or Destroyers can obliterate your ship.
- Pricey for such a ship.

## Strategy

- Use this Ship's relatively small profile and high mobility to avoid fire and drift around the enemy.
