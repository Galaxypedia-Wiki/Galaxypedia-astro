{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Jackal_**is a powerful [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-focused [**Battleship.**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)

## Description

The **Jackal** is a [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-heavy ship that has a nice balance between [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage. Compared to the [Sentaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz), which is another spinal-heavy battleship, the **Jackal** is very large, which is partly due to the remarkable amount of damage it produces.

The exterior of the ship is very ornate. On the sides, you will find an array of beautiful and complex ridges and lines that give a sci-fi aesthetic to the ship. On the bottom is a large orb of neon orange/blue energy, likely the 'Hyperion Core' mentioned on the ship's console.

## Appearance

The **Jackal's **interior is a small but incredibly detailed hallway leading up to the pilot's seat. The pilot seat itself glows orange, and is flanked on each side by two statues. In front of the pilot seat is a screen which reads "Jackal Artillery Systems, Operation: Devistation, Hyperion Core: Operational"

## Advantages

- Very high overall damage, with a good balance between hull and shield damage.
- The Jackal's Large-sized [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) makes it have plenty of range, 5.25k for the phasers and 6.25k for the cannons.
- Well-placed Spinals.
- Very fast speed for a battleship

## Disadvantages

- If you cannot aim spinals well, it is very difficult to deal with smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- No Turrets.
- Low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) for a Battleship.
- Due to it being bulky, it is easy to be hit while the Jackal is not moving.

## Strategy

- Group up with other **Jackals** to make a fleet of near-unstoppable power.
- Stay away from smaller Ships like the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra) or [Gideon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gideon), as these can swarm and kill you.
- Stay with Ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or the [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr) to negate your lack of precise weapons.
- It is not recommended to go alone, as you have little defense against small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Keep distance from your enemies, you want minimal turret damage hitting you.
- A very good anti-siege ship as it can snipe bigger targets with ease.
- Utilize vertical [Drifting]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting) while facing opponents, this can make it tougher for them to hit your ship.

## Version History

- Received a buff in update .60d that buffed Hull by 400 and Shields by 600. While also increased slightly in cost to build. The buff was reversed shortly after.
- Buffed in .63h to add 500 Shield, 100 Hull, and increased the price.
- Buffed in .66b, with its shields going from 2000 to 3000 and having its turnspeed go from 0.11 to 0.22.
- Received a remodel and buff in version ???, which increased it's turn speed to 0.5.
- 1 Large Cannon removed in version .69a1.
- Explosion Size 100 ----> 320 .75a12

## Trivia

- The **Jackal** can capture a full health [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion) in 20 minutes.
- Looks like an orbital gun.
- On the front screen where the pilot sits it says "Operation: Devistation" but devastation is spelled wrong.
- The heads of the statues in the ship are identical to that of a real-life jackal, which makes sense considering the ship's name.
- These statues also resemble the Egyptian god, Anubis.
- Essentially a United States of Razor but almost 1/3 of the price and has more firepower and is not limited.
- It has a limited time counterpart, the [Jack-Al' Lantern]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jack-Al'-Lantern).
- According to the **Jackal**'s description, it was designed with the same power source as a super capital, namely the [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion). This can be seen on the exterior of the ship, as the core is exposed underneath the ship; and also the interior, with the screen in front of the pilot seat mentioning a 'Hyperion Core'.
