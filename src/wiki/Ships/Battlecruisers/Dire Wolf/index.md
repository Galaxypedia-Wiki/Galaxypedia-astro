{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Dire Wolf_** is a classic **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)** with high [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.

## Description

The **Dire Wolf** is a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) with a unique [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) layout, high firepower, and decent health. It is very combat-oriented with equal [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage. Its name is written on both sides of the ship. It has a very unique, recognizable design.

It is also said to be the "best" ship from Rcouret.

## Appearance

The **Dire Wolf** contains a pilot seat with a screen on the front. Behind it is a hallway with many seats and displays and a table showing a Galaxy map. Behind that is a reactor room with a control panel that is similar to the Chimera.

## Advantages

- High firepower against both [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Decent health in both shields and hull.
- Good speed.

## Disadvantages 

- It suffers from low mobility for a [Battlecruiser.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fire one after the other, not at the same time, making it hard to hit with both against faster targets.
- Vulnerable bottom
- 3rd most expensive [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) in the build menu.
- Very easy to hit.

## Strategy 

- Can easily fire at enemies above it.
- Great as a support ship among a fleet.
- Use of [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are necessary to destroy [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) so fighting with others is recommended.
- In PVP, face your opponent straight on so all your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) can hit; drifting is recommended

## Version History

- Remodeled in an unknown version.
- 1 [Medium Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) moved to the top of the ship, 2 [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) upsized to 2 [Large Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and Top Speed increased from 130 to 140 in version .68e.
- 2 Medium Flak cannons replaced with 2 Medium Point Defense Lasers in version .72d4.

## Trivia

- The Dire Wolf's model is based on the 2nd SSV Normandy from the original Mass Effect trilogy.
- Two **Dire Wolves** are enough to take on a [Nemesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nemesis) if the pilots are skilled enough.
- The Control panel in the reactor room is the same as the one in the [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera).
- One of the ships Rcouret likes to spawn in game.
- Originally, this ship was one of the gamepasses in [Galaxy Arcade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Arcade). This feature was removed later on. It received another gamepass in version .69d1.![Old Dire Wolf
