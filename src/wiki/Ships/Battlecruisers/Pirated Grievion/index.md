The **_Pirated Grievion_** is a limited [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018) remodel of the [Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grievion). ![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Screenshot-2019-02-28-at-3.48.47-PM.png-"Screenshot-2019-02-28-at-3.48.47-PM.png"){width="221" height="221"}

## Description

The **Pirated Grievion** shares the same model as the original [Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grievion), but is made almost entirely out of wood. It has actual pirate ship cannons lining the side, along with Flak Cannons, and has dark black side wings.

## Interior

The interior of the **Pirated Grievion** is similar to the layout of the [Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grievion), but is also made entirely out of wood. The cargo containers near the front are replaced with pirate treasure chests. It also contains an easter egg in one of the walls.

## Advantages

- Much more health compared to its normal counterpart(the [Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grievion)).
- Much faster firing spinals compared to its normal counterpart.
- Equipped with a near-unique set of pirate-themed turrets, giving this ship good turret firepower.

## Disadvantages

- Limited event ship makes it a prime target for trophy hunters or pirates.
- Expensive for its class.

## Strategy

- Use this to pirate isolated Miners or Freighters, but be weary when doing so as you are an attention-grabbing target.
