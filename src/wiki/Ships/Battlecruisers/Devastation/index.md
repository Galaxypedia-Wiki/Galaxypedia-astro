{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Devastation_** is a [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) class ship with heavy [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets).

## Description

The **Devastation** is a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) with emphasis on support.

## Appearance

Devastation is a long grey [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) that has an enlarged section in the front and four backside thrusters on the back.Â There is an flag with a bird on each side of the ship.

The <u>**Interior**</u> can be accessed by walking through the door, there is a chair that sits in front of a screen. On the left, there is an anime profile picture, possibly of Wiscyy, the creator of the ship.

Currently the model is slightly broken, with some parts being [Partshifted]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang).

## Advantages

- Great [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement, and range.
- Very high cargo hold for a Battlecruiser.
- 2nd Highest health of all non-event [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Disadvantages

- Incredibly sluggish maneuverability for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Long reloads due to the lack of rapid-fire turrets.
- Very poor damage output for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), being worse than several [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) due to the poor turret armament and weak [Spinal Weaponry]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Very weak against small [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships), even worse when against large numbers.
- Retired ship, making it limited and a huge target.

## Strategy

- Keep the enemy in front to make use of the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Support sieges and fleets.
- Use [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) for extra shield damage.
- Best used against other [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) and/or larger ships as the [Heavy Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) struggle to hit smaller ships, though larger Cruisers like the [Gryphon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gryphon) and [Spectre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spectre) are an exception depending on the range.

## Version History

- Name fixed in .69d.
- 1 [Heavy Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replaced with 1 [Dual Medium Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .71b.
- Made offsale and archived in .75a12 due to numerous problems such as partshift.

## Trivia

- This ship's name used to be misspelled; it used to be '**Devestation**', rather than **'Devastation**', as it is now. rcouret added a system to rename ships in version .69d.
- On the wall next to the pilot's seat is a pinned image of the ship's creator.
- Had the highest cargo hold of all [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) until the [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen) was introduced.
- Has the same antenna array as the [Hasatan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hasatan) and [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera), since they're all made by the same creator.
- The emblem on the side is that of the Commonwealth of Man from Stellaris.
- The ship has been retired.
