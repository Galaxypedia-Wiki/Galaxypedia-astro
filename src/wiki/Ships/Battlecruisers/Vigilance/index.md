{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Vigilance_** is a heavy [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets)-focused [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Description

The **Vigilance** is a large [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) that focuses on broadside weaponry.

## Interior

The interior is very basic, having a seat and various plain-looking neon control panels. It is rather small and is barely tall enough for the player to stand in.

## Advantages

- Cheap for a battlecruiser.
- High health for its class.
- The broadside-oriented loadout makes it effective in combat, especially against larger ships.
- Its two [Medium Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can target enemies from long distances.
- The broadside spinals can deal high amounts of damage if used correctly.
- High shield DPS for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Disadvantages

- Pathetic Maneuverability and Acceleration, leading to the backside being highly vulnerable.
- Its broadside profile makes it an easy target for [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Slow for its class.
- Rather low Hull damage.
- Currently has no pilot's seat.
- A little expensive for a starter.

## Strategy

- Use it as a support ship in [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) battles.
- Do not go head to head with a smaller more maneuverable ship like a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), as your slow maneuverability will leave you at a disadvantage.
- Just like both the Osiris and [Behemoth]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), attack broadside for all your weapons to hit your enemy.

## Version History

- Shield was buffed from 0 to 1250 in version .65b after it was added.
- Broadside spinals added in version .66b
- Turn Speed increased from 0.2 to 0.3, and Acceleration increased from 10 to 12.5 in version .75a5.
- Spinal interval decreased from 0.1 -> 0 (all spinals shoot simultaneously) .75a12

## Trivia

- Looked like a mini Armageddon before the Armageddon was remodeled.
- Its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are placed for a broadside position to work best when firing at a target.
- the ship is some times thought to look like a Train.
- This ship somewhat resembles the [Galleon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galleon)
