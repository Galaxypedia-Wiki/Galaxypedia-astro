The **_Heartbreaker_** is a [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) which was made for Valentine's Day 2020. It was re-released on Valentine's Day 2021, then again on Valentine's Day 2024.

## Description

The **Heartbreaker** largely has a color scheme of pink and red. It has a fairly retro building style, using mostly vanilla studio bricks and as few meshes as a possible. It was sold by Confinium (NPC) on the 3rd floor of the [VIP lounge]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Lounge).

## Interior

The ship's interior consists of a chair next to a teleporter underneath a glass dome. Behind the chair is a small container labeled "Heartifact Storage".

## Advantages

- Very high health for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Good mobility.
- Very powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- High DPS.

## Disadvantages

- Requires [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aiming in order to deal efficient [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Very expensive for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- If destroyed, you cannot get it back (unless refunded).
- A target for pirates as it is an event ship.
- Very small cargo hold compared to other Battlecruisers.

## Strategy

- Spinal aim is crucial in dealing effective shield damage.
- Use with caution, as it is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ship and will be focused in a battle.

## Version History

- Taken offsale on an unknown date.
- Top Speed increased from 120 to 135, 1 [Medium Phaser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) added and put back on-sale (for Valentine's Day only) in version .71b2.

## Trivia

- The first Valentine's Day ship to be added to Galaxy.
- The first Heartbreaker to be destroyed was thecoolestguyeverrrr's Heartbreaker. It was destroyed by Bomb_Pops's [3D Printed Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}3D-Printed-Warlock).
- Has custom [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and Turret sounds.
- Better [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) than some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- The creator of this ship, Poke, originally made the **Heartbreaker** grey, but then the old Admin Director, Confinium, made it pink, leading to some drama that has since been dealt with.
