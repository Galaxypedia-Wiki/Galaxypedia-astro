The **_Hecate_** Is a **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)** Class ship that excels at crushing the hulls of other ships.

## Description

The **Hecate** can deal significant Hull damage. The **Hecate's** exterior features two primary engines, two large fins, and two sets of six [Medium Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) barrels. It was the first ship with [Medium Flaks]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). (Now replaced with [Dual Gatlings]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and then Tiny Lasers)

## Interior

The current design's interior is very empty. You enter using a door in the side, revealing an empty room with nothing but a pilot's seat and a long window at the front.

## Advantages

- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) do a lot of hull damage.
- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) deal out tons of shield damage against smaller [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- Powerful Hull damage.
- High cargo for its class.
- Can support various roles such as PvP, support, and chasing.
- Good speed and maneuverability.

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable bottom.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) have a slow fire rate.
- Lacking in [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Expensive for a battlecruiser.
- Requires [VIP.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass)
- Bad placement of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets);

## Strategy

- Overall, this ship should really only be used to chase down hulled ships.
- This ship does not perform well alone against multiple small ships. Stay with a fleet.
- Use this ship in sieges. Its [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) deal high hull damage and it is capable of taking down other [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), such as the [Dire Wolf]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dire-Wolf). It can even challenge some [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) such the [Cutlass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cutlass).
