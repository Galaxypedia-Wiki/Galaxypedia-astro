The **_Cruzin4Bruzin_** is a **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)** that costs 15 million credits and is exclusive to VIP players.

## Description

The **Cruzin4Bruzin** is obtained from a quest in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) that is exclusive to VIPs and costs 15 million credits. It is quite powerful for a battlecruiser with a respectable 221 total dps, but is generally seen as not worth it's cost.

## Appearance

The **Cruzin4Bruzin** is a bright yellow combination of the [Vigilance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vigilance) and the [Belvat]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Belvat), with it's wings coming from the [Belvat]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Belvat), and the rest of the ship from the [Vigilance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vigilance). It's interior is identical to the [Vigilance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vigilance).

## Advantages

- Decent mobility.
- High firepower for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), with 7 [Medium Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) and 1 [Large Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets).
- Has multiple high-accuracy turrets, great for AA.
- Good [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Amazing [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) strength for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Disadvantages

- Is less effective against [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) than against [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- When spawned in, you are a massive target and just about everyone will try to kill you.
- <u>Extremely</u> expensive.

## Strategy

- This ship is worth so much and has comparably poor stats, so it's really a trophy ship.
- If you do have to use this ship, be <u>extremely</u> careful, as its quite likely the entire server will stop at nothing kill it, even going as far as nuking entire fleets.
- It's a horrible idea, but if it's necessary to go into combat with this ship, warp out before you get hulled and try to use the **Cruzin4Bruzin's** high DPS and accuracy to take on smaller ships.

## Version History

- Added in version .76d42?

## Trivia

- As of 6/22/2024 Only VindictiveXZ has been spotted flying this ship.
