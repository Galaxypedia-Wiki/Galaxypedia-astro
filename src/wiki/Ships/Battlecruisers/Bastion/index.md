{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Bastion_** is a **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)** with lots of [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower and health.

## Description

The **Bastion** is a heavy [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) that focuses on [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower. Its main body features two large protruding thrusters and an elevated cockpit area with a rounded window. This ship's relatively high turret count makes it effective against both smaller ships and larger ships.

## Appearance

Once entering the **Bastion**, you will enter a small room with no interior but a single seat.

## Advantages

- Variety of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- No blind spots.
- Very high health.
- Great for beginners, as it has ease of use with the turret based armament and is a good ship as an introduction to [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships).
- Good damage output with the turrets.

## Disadvantages

- Below average speed.
- Though not a blind spot, the bottom is poorly defended.
- Due to the way the ship is shaped you have to turn it to get it out of dock which can give time to enemy [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) to do damage.

## Strategy

- Performs well as a support ship in sieges as it has many small [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to destroy incoming small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Best used for attacking [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) below its size, as it has trouble with [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) of same class due to its inferior mobility causing it to be unable to escape easily.
- Against [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), exploiting blind spots is your best bet against them.

## Version History

- In an older version <span>it used to have a massive explosion upon death, which heavily damaged nearby [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) and destroyed baseÂ </span>[Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets)<span>. This has since been fixed.</span>
- Buffed in .64d to gain another [Medium Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 100 more health in each stat.
- Medium Lasers replaced with Point Defense Laser and Long Range Laser in version .66b
- 1 Long Range Laser replaced with 1 [Point Defense Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .69e due to the Long Range Laser's removal from the game.
- 2 [Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) changed to 2 Dual Medium Lasers and 1 Medium Railgun changed to 1 Heavy Railgun in version .73c10.
- 2 Light Lasers and 1 Heavy Railgun replaced with 1 Heavy Siege Railgun, and 2 Dual Medium Cannons in version .75a5.
- Dual Medium Cannons and Dual Medium Lasers replaced with Triple Medium versions, the Heavy Siege Railgun replaced with a SR PDL, Shield/Hull health increased from 1,950/2,000 to 2,100/2,200 respectively, Top Speed increased from 90 to 95, Turn Speed increased from 0.48 to 0.5, and Acceleration increased from 23 to 34 in version .75a5.

## Trivia

- Named after a defensive architectural design built into medieval European castles. A **Bastion** protruded from a castle's walls, allowing defenders to attack from all angles.
- The **Bastion** was one of the most used ships in [Galaxy Arcade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Arcade) before it received a gamepass in version .69d1
- The original **Bastion** model had an easter egg that includes a Gnome on a desk with a few pieces of blank paper.![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gnome.png-"Gnome.png"){width="220" height="220"}
- For a period of time the **Bastion** could not move or dock. The whole situation started with the gnome's hat falling off and preventing the ship from moving.
- The right console on the original model had some memes like the illuminati triangle on it.
