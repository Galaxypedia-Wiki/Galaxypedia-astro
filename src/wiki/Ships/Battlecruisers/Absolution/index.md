{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Absolution_** is a **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)** with unique ship design and powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Description 

The **Absolution** is a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) with many details ranging from a large half tube that houses the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), to the large hole in the middle of the ship.

It can deal massive damage with its two [Large Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). Its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are located on the top. With four [Medium Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and two [Light Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), this is a great alternative to the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).

## Appearance

The interior is largely inaccessible and is hard to make out what is inside, due to collision issues with the ship's model. It does however, possess at least a bare-bones interior of a square pilot seat and some surrounding walling from what is visible.

## Advantages

- High overall [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- Decent mobility for a [Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) of its Class.
- High overall health.
- Great for taking down small [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- Able to take down larger [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) if you exploit their blind spots.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), being large, have long range.

## Disadvantages 

- Vulnerable bottom.
- Unbalanced damage, better at taking down hull.
- One of the more expensive Battlecruisers.

## Strategy

- Attack from below other ships if you can. Your mobility should allow you to stay below most ships.
- Utilize your powerful [Large Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to maximize damage.
