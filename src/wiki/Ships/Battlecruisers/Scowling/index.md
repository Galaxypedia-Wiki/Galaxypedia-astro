The **_Scowling_** is an [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) class ship based on the [Nidhogg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nidhogg).

## Description

It has a brighter brown-gold color scheme, as opposed to the dark brown coloring of the player-owned Nidhogg. This ship also has more health and firepower than the Nidhogg, likely resulting in its Battlecruiser classification rather than inheriting the Nidhogg's Cruiser classification.

The **Scowling** has a weaker counterpart in the [Jormungand]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jormungand), which now spawns in place of(?) the **Scowling**, meaning this ship is effectively removed from the game(?).

## Interior

This ship does not have an interior

## Advantages

- Strong [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- Above average shield damage.

## Disadvantages

- Weak shields for a Battlecruiser
- Susceptible to shield tanks due to its reliance on [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) for [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.

## Strategy

- Use a ship with powerful and accurate [Hull-breaking]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}hull-breakers) [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) to defeat this ship as it is small and has little shields
