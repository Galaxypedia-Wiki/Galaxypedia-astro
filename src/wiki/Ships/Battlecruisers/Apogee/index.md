The **Apogee** is a limited Battlecruiser, and a part of the [Halloween Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2023).

## Description

The Apogee is a small Battlecruiser featuring a new homing missile [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules). It could be obtained from the U.N.E. Harbormaster in terminal C of the Mega Base for 55,000 credits during the [2023 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2023). It is equipped with a volley of homing missiles, activated by pressing B. It is the only ship to have this type of weaponry.

## Appearance

The Apogee is very small, especially for its class. It has a similar style to the [Deity]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Deity), [Theseus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus), and [Odyssey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Odyssey), featuring similar colors, engines, and details. Additionally it is almost completely the same on both the top and bottom, just like the other [Halloween Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2023) ships. It has three missile launchers mounted on each side, with its turrets on the top and bottom.

## Advantages

- Small and fast, making it hard to hit at range.
- High speed and good spinal DPS, making it effective at drifting.
- Homing missiles deal high damage and have a great range of 8 thousand studs.
- Each turret has very good LoS.
- Homing missiles make it extremely good at hunting down small ships.

## Disadvantages

- Limited and will most likely never return as a buyable ship.
- Rebuild price is around 100k, far more than other battlecruisers or even battleships.
- This ship is a target because of its effectiveness in fleets, availability, and cost.
- Turrets, while having good LoS, do very little damage.

## Strategy

- Always watch your back, you will be a target.
- Don't get too close to anything that could seriously damage you; just snip with your missiles.
- Support fleets by using missiles to hunt down frigates, destroyers, and small fighters.

## Version History

- Added in version .77a31 as a quest ship costing 55,000 credits.

## Trivia

- Released early by accident on the 13th of Friday of October 2023 due to development issues.
- The only battlecruiser with a [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules).
- The only ship with any sort of homing weaponry.
