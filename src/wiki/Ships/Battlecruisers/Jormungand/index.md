The **_Jormungand_** is a Pirate **[AI]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)** that acts as the big brother to the [Dragoon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragoon).

## Description

The **_Jormungand_** is a [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) that has high shield damage compared to other [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) ships.

## Behavior

The Jormungand behaves identically to the pattern of an [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) ship. This ship, like the [Dragoon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragoon) and weaker [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), cannot call reinforcements to its side, but will respond to the calls of [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak), [X-0]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}X-0), or [Galleon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galleon).

1-3 Jormungands have a chance to spawn every 10 Minutes.

One unusual factor about it that sets it unique from other [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) Ships is that you can grab its attention up to 25k Studs away, unlike the normal 14k Stud attention range. This means that if you were 20k Studs away from a Jormungand, it would lock on to you.

## Strategy

- Move near it so that it turns its back from you and blocks its spinals from firing.
- If you don't plan on using a capital ship, it is suggested to use a ship with powerful spinal weaponry like the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing) or [Guillotine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Guillotine)
- The Jormungand can not be seen without the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) for ~100k studs.

## Loot

10 [Armor Scrap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armor-Scrap), 50 [Material Scrap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Material-Scrap) and ~5.5k in combat rewards.

## Version History

- 4 Small Phasers on the [F] spinal changed to 3 Small Phasers, and 2 Phasers added as the [G] spinal in version ???.
- 15 Armor Scraps added for loot in version .73c10.
- Size up-scaled, combat rewards increased by ~65%, can now detect up to 6k away instead of 14k away in version .74b17.
- Model changed from [Nidhogg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nidhogg) to [Radiance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Radiance) in version .75a15.

## Trivia

- This ship was added to the game without being announced in the [Update Log]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Update-Log).
- The name of this ship comes from Norse Mythology, from [JÃ¶rmungandr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungand), otherwise known as the World Serpent.
