The'Mjolnheimr**\*is a** [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:battlecruiser)**based on the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream)**.\*'

##  Description

The **Mjolnheimr** is a uniquely shaped [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) reminiscent of the Slipstream. It makes a fairly effective defense ship when dealing with [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) or [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Appearance

The cockpit is quite simple, only having a few basic details.

##  Advantages

- Fairly large health pool.
- Balanced shield and hull damage.
- High accuracy.
- Small size.

##  Disadvantages

- Slow top speed and acceleration.
- Poor maneuverability.
- Short effective range.
- Low damage output.

##  Strategy

- Do not attack ships above your class.
- Due to the low range of most of its Turrets, you have to get close or you won't be able to use all of them.
- Good for countering [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) because it can quickly kill most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Version History

- Rebalanced in .75a5.
- Received 2 [Gatling Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 1 [Gatling Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to replace 2 [Light Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 1 [Light Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in .64d, as well as 200 more hull.
- Received a remodel in version .66b.
- Rebalanced in an unknown version.
- Shield 4600 -> 3100, Hull 2800 -> 1800 .76d36

##  Trivia

- Mjolnir (or [Mjölnir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mj%C3%B6lnir)) is the name of the hammer used by the Norse god of thunder, Thor.
