{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_MLRS_** is a [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-carrying [**Battlecruiser.**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)

## Description

The **MLRS**is a [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) focused [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers). It was released on December 20th, 2018; when the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018) started.

## Appearance

The **MLRS** has 2 large torpedo launchers on its back and is larger than most [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

The Interior is a large glass dome in the middle of the ship with a seat and 3 screens positioned in front of the seat.

## Advantages

- Great amount of health for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Has [Medium Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) which can be used to siege [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and large [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) from afar.
- Very good at PvP if the pilot is skilled with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Disadvantages

- Very vulnerable to fast, small ships as it will have a hard time hitting its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and has very low [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) reload slowly, and have an undesirable firing interval of 1.2 seconds if you're trying to [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Pirating) other ships.
- Very expensive for its class.
- The slowest [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), slower than some [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Vulnerable bottom.
- Large size for its class.
- Low maneuverability.

## Strategy

- Use its [Medium Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to heavily damage large and sluggish ships from a distance.
- Stay in the back of the fleet and kill any small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) that come your way, while attacking larger targets with your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Use your [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to attack larger, slower moving ships such as slow-moving [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), as smaller [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) can evade your [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Go near targets for more accurate Torpedo hits.
- Stay out of the range of [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) turrets and use the small turrets to get rid of any fighters or small ships coming your way during sieges.
- If you get targeted, you will usually be destroyed. Try to stay behind more expensive ships and don't attack directly.

## Trivia

- Added during the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).
- There is a limited remodel of this ship, named the [Frozen MLRS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frozen-MLRS).
- It contains unique re-skinned missiles, however, they do the same damage as [Medium Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). Its old model used to have the same missile models used on the <span style="color:#8dfc80">[Frozen MLRS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frozen-MLRS)</span>.
- Even though the MRLS Launcher has 6 torpedoes, it used to only fire 2 of them on its old model a long time ago.
- The old model's back engines had a look similar to the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2)'s engines.
- A variant of the MRLS Launcher was released for free in the battlecruiser menu on March 31st for the [April Fool's Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2022). It was called the [MRLS Launcher Launcher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MRLS-Launcher-Launcher) (later renamed [MLMLRS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MLMLRS)). It had 251 small torpedoes and 4 Large torpedoes that did tremendous amounts of damage. It was 3 times bigger than a MRLS Launcher and had the same model. The torpedoes are small white MRLS Launchers. During that time, people used it as a mega cool troll ship. It was later stripped of its 251 small torpedoes as they were incredibly overpowered for their class.
