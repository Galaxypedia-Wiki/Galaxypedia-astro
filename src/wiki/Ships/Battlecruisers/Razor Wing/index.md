{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Razor Wing_** is a [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-oriented [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) well known for its ability to "tackle" larger ships.

## Description

The **Razor Wing** is a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) which, unlike most ships, is asymmetrical due to the large wing on its starboard side. It is also quite well known for its ability to take on large ships, making it good for [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) and base defense.

## Appearance

There is a small energy core pillar directly inside from the doorway, as well as a set of six chairs leading to the front cockpit, which itself has a black pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Powerful [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) weaponry that can deal high burst damage.
- [Light turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) help defend against [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)/[Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
- Two or three of these can possibly take on [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), but only if the pilots are "extremely skilled".
- One of the more affordable **Battlecruisers**.
- Can be used to kill [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) with little difficulty. Furthermore, it can heavily damage or even bring down an [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) if it's unprotected by [Alien Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer).
- Potentially unstoppable in a complex fleet.

## Disadvantages

- Low health.
- Vulnerable bottom.
- Very well-known, making **Razor Wings** a high priority.
- May struggle against [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) with high health or with lots of high-accuracy [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets).
- Less [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) Damage.
-

## Strategy

- You can shoot bigger ships with its ridiculously powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and hit very small [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) with its 2 Flak Cannons.
- Destroy everyone with your Spinal fury, and watch out for ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) and the [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest), whose arrays of small armaments will make mincemeat out of you.
- Annoy **Dreadnoughts** whenever you spot one that can't defend against smaller ships.
- Swarming is effective: While one is an annoyance, many are outright deadly.

## Version History

- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) nerfed in .60(?) to only 4 barrels. 4 Flaks reduced to 2 Flaks and one Cannon.
- Remodeled in .61h1(?).
- Small buff in .64d that added 25 health to each stat, increased turn speed, and raised Cannons to 6 barrels (from 4).
- Nerfed in version .66b - spinal counts reduced to 3 barrels on both the Cannons and Phasers.
- Cargo Hold increased from 150 to 300, both spinal counts increased to 4 barrels in version .68e.
