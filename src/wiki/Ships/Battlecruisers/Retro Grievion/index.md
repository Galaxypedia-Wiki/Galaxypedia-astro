The **_Retro Grievion_** is a **[limited-edition]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** version of the [Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grievion) that features its original model and armament.

## Description

The **Retro Grievion** is a limited model the [Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grievion) that is an improved version of the original Grievion from Galaxy Alpha.

It was only available for a limited time.

## Interior

The interior is accessed through a transparent door leading into the ship from where it docks. There is a short hallway with two rooms on both sides of the hallway, leading to the bridge. The pilots seat is the first chair, in the center of the room towards the front facing a glass window. The other chairs in the room do not seem to be able to be sat in, and you can walk through them as if they don't exist. This problem is had by other retro ships at the moment, such as the [Retro Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Hawklight). The two rooms branching from the hallway each have some beds, one has a fridge, and there are a few other various living appliances in them. Nothing in these rooms have any collision, like the chairs. the walls separating them from the hallway do not have collision either, and you may walk through them.

## Advantages

- Amazing [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) firepower, considering retro Turrets do a lot more damage than normal ones.
- High health.

## Disadvantages

- Targeted because of its high value.
- Mediocre acceleration for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
