- <s>People will know when it is spawned due to its loud music giving away it's presence even from a long distance.</s>

## Version History

- Model Fixed in ???

## Trivia

- It has a fully modeled mini version of a capital cannon on the bottom. However, as of now it is just for vanity purposes.
- When spawned, the song "[Darude - Sandstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6120QOlsfU)" plays. **For unknown reasons it does not play the song anymore**
- Just like the previous April Fool's ship, the [Prototype X-3]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-3), the event was very similar, as it required players to travel far off the map and asked a joke price of 6,000,000 credits, but in addition of an alien device and a weapon's part, in the end costing only 25,000 credits.
- When the ship is in warp mode, the soundtrack becomes distorted. This may be an attempt to replicate the Doppler effect in-game.
- Name is based on the tyrant, a test super-capital.
- It is the second ship to have "baby" in the name. The other being [Baby Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Baby-Leviathan)
- It is modeled after the Tyrant from Star conflict.
- <s> Its a red hyperion lmao <s>
