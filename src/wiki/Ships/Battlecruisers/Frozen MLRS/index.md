The **_Frozen MRLS_** is a [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018) variant of the [MLRS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MLRS).

## Description

The **Frozen MLRS**is a redesign of the [MLRS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MLRS). It was released December 20, 2018, when the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018) update came out. It was obtained as a quest reward from "[Gámér Gamer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gámér-Gamer)" on [Aqueous II]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous-II).

## Appearance

The ship's interior consists of a single seat and some holograms in the middle of a glass dome.0

## Advantages

- Great health for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Has a good arsenal of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) for its class.
- Large Cargo Hold for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Can be used to siege [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) from afar.
- Extremely powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Very high alpha damage for its class.

## Disadvantages

- Required 25 [Snowflakes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowflake).

## Strategy

- Use its [Large Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and perfect timing to heavily damage certain targets at all times.
- Just like its normal counterpart, the [MLRS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MLRS), it's useful in sieges with other siege ships such as the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker).
- Use your [Light Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to defend yourself from small ships.

## Version History

- Added in .65b.
- [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) sizes increased to [Medium Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) later in .65b.
- [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) sizes were increased again, from [Medium Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to [Large Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in .65b. The total health was also increased by 50 [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 5 [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Received a small colorization remodeling; instead of a rusty, frozen-over siege ship, it features a hi-tech design, perhaps due to the buffs it has received.
- Turret loadout changed from 4 Light Lasers, 2 Light Flak Cannons to 4 Sickles, 2 Splitters, added trails in version .73a3
- Renamed from Frozen MRLS Launcher to Frozen MLRS in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- Added for the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).
- Considerably viewed on par with some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) for sieging power and combat prowess.
- When you turn in the materials and [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) needed to obtain the **Frozen MLRS**, you may notice that 75k [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) were not given to the [NPC]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) contrary to the quest's requirements. This was not a result of a bug or glitch, but was scrapped by ARiNA last minute, according to a DM response on Discord.
- If you were to kill this when the player has 0 [Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty), you'd gain approximately 15k [Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty).
- The second ship that required additional [Uranium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) to be exchanged in order to earn the ship.
- Prior to the remodel, the **Frozen MRLS**looked like this: ![The Old
