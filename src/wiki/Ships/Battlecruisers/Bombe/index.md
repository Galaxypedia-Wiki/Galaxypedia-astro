{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **Bombe** is a joke ship created for the 1-year anniversary of the [Enigma Cache Incident]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Enigma-Cache-Incident).

## Description

The **Bombe** is an incredibly powerful joke ship with the worst accuracy of any ship in the game, configured in such a way that its ridiculously high damage-per-second can never be unleashed as it is mathematically impossible for the ship's turrets to hit a shot.

To obtain the ship, you had to talk to an [advanced ship computer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Ship-Computers) at the end of a hidden maze inside [Pyramus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pyramus). The hint given by developer GodrevyD, as with everything else associated with the ship, was fully written in binary. When translated, it read;

_"--Added a new ship for enigma demotion soon TM if you figured out how to get the text from this good work the quest is on a planet go find"._

After completing the quest at [Pyramus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pyramus), you will be charged 10,000 credits and given the **Bombe**.

## Interior

The Bombe has no interior, just a seat on top of the ship.

## Advantages

- Highest DPS of any playable ship.
- Very high health for it's class.
- High speed.

## Disadvantages

- Huge target for pirates.
- Will **NEVER** hit a shot, no matter the circumstances.

## Strategy

- Troll your enemies by getting people to use the :info command on the Bombe, so they see its stunning DPS, before spawning it.
- Do not be fooled by its power. It will lose any and every fight it gets into.
- Roleplay as an advanced ship computer?

## Trivia

- The binary on the model of the [advanced ship computer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Ship-Computers) that gives the **Bombe** translates to "trolling".
- The description of the ship translates to "This trolling".
- The "[Bombe]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:Bombe#:~:text=The-bombe-(UK:-/b,messages-during-World-War-II.)" was a supercomputer created by Alan Turing during World War 2, designed to decipher the German encryption known as the "[Enigma]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:Enigma-machine#:~:text=The-Enigma-machine-is-a,branches-of-the-German-military.)".
  - This is the reasoning for the ship's name, as it was released on the anniversary of the [Enigma Cache Incident]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Enigma-Cache-Incident). It also explains the ship's appearance.
- The ship is a jab at how people often jump to conclusions about how good or bad a ship is based on its damage output, rather than considering its range, health, speed, or accuracy.
  - While the ship has ludicrously high damage, it's tracking accuracy is set to such a high number that the game cannot comprehend it and sets the value to 0. Because of how Galaxy's combat works, this means even if the projectile makes contact with the target, it will never deal any damage.
