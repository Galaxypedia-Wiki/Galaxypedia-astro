{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Disruptor_**is the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) version of the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing), and was released following the hunt for the hidden [Prototype X-3]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-3).

## Description

The **Disruptor**is an Alien redesign of the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).

It comes equipped with 4 [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) cannon-based weapons, instead of the usual loadout for the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).

The Disruptor contains an impressive loadout of [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), making it good for [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) and engaging [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), as well as engaging Small Ships with it's flak turrets.

The **Disruptor** can be acquired by completing the quest at [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion), located by teleporting to the **Lucifer Station**, then head to the station's farthest room, which is a caf√© area - you'll find him inside the open vents located beside the stove. The quest requires 1.6k [Silicate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1.3k [Carbon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1k [Iridium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 625 [Adamantite]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 625 [Palladium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 625 [Titanium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 625 [Quantium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 1 [Alien Device]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Device), 1 [Disruptor thrust systems]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Disruptor-thruster-systems), and 60k credits.

## Appearance

The **Disruptor** is an asymmetrical and small [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers). Unlike the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing). this variant has [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens)-themed colors.

The **Interior** is similar to the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing)'s interior. There is a pilot seat in the very front, and a long hallway with four corridors branching off of it.

It can sometimes be confusing to try and get out of the Disruptor**,**as all the doors look the same.

## Advantages

- Great and [Balanced]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) [DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), at 239.
- The [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on top provide good defense while the [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) loadout contains an even higher damage output.
- Moves quick for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) and a top speed of 120.
- Higher health than its [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing) counterpart.
- Unlike other [Kneall]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations) Ships, most of the Disruptor's turrets are accurate.

## Disadvantages

- Has no form of defense underneath, making it high priority to keep the fight away from your underside.
- Relies on spinals for much of its damage output, thus requiring good aim.
- High [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) count and long interval may make it difficult to engage small ships when using its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Low health for a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ship.
- Extremely expensive material cost for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)-class Ship, requiring 5000 Uranium.

## Strategy

- With an excellent armament towards PvP, it's best intended for either finishing off a crippled ship in a swarm, or attacking an unsuspecting vessel.
- Be extremely careful with this, as people will focus on you and go for the rare kill due to it having a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) status and its expense.
- The low health makes this an easy target for skilled players if not careful.
