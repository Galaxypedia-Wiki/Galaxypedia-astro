The **_Patriotic Devastation_** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) added during the [2021 Fourth of July Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fourth-of-july-2021).

## Description

The **Patriotic Devastation** is a reskinned [Devastation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastation) added during the 2021 Fourth of July Event. It features improved firepower and health over its regular counterpart, as well as a red, white, and blue color scheme. Its model is largely identical to that of the original Devastation, featuring the same eagle logo and team-colored background.

## Interior

The interior of the **Patriotic Devastation** is similar to that of the regular Devastation, but with a patriotic color scheme.

## Advantages

- Has more health, maneuverability, and firepower than its non-limited counterpart.
- Small and Medium turrets allow for decent defense against smaller ships.
- Dual-barrel Phasers give it high shield damage and some redundancy if spinals miss.

## Disadvantages

- Hull damage is limited due to the comparatively weak output of its gatling cannons.
- The limited nature of this ship makes it more of a target.

## Strategy

- Utilize the mainly shield-focused firepower to burn the shields of enemy ships.
- Pair up with a [Hull-breaker]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}hull-breakers) to compensate for the weak hull damage.

## Version History

- Recolored in version .72e4
