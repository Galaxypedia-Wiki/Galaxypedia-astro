The **_Valkerac_** is a [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) added during the [2021 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).

## Description

The Valkerac is a Halloween 2021 Battlecruiser with [Karaclaves]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), which are reskinned Dual Medium Lasers.

## Interior

None.

## Advantages

- High maneuverability.
- High health pool for a battlecruiser
- Unique [Karaclaves]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) deal mainly shield damage
- Thin body allows it to speedtank most turrets

## Disadvantages

- Relies on Medium Cannon spinals for Hull Damage.
- Moderate portion of its HP in shields, making it somewhat susceptible to shield breakers like the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) or [Sagittarius]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sagittarius)
- Difficult to get out of due to the small cockpit, often leading to the pilot getting stuck.

## Strategy

- The Valkerac is just a tankier [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen) with less speed and cargohold
- Use the Karaclaves to take down an enemy's shields, then the Medium Cannons to finish them off

## Version History

- Fixed an issue where you would fall off when going in/out of it .75a12

## Trivia

- One of the only 2 non-NPC ships that has encrypted :info command data, the other being [Halkaryak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halkaryak).
- The first person to lose one was [**FATTZO**](https://www.roblox.com/users/123258715/profile), to **[GoldenSpatulaa](https://www.roblox.com/users/138161196/profile)**'s Galaxy, only around 30 minutes after the event launched.
- The Valkerac is basically a [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen) and a [Nautilus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nautilus) combined
- Teleporter is extremely bugged, with the [Revenant]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revenant)
