The **_Maple Syrup Launcher_** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) added during the [2021 Fourth of July Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fourth-of-july-2021).

## Description

The **Maple Syrup Launcher** is a Canadian-themed Battlecruiser added during the second part of the 2021 Fourth of July Event. It is based on the [MRLS Launcher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MRLS-Launcher), but features a red and white color scheme and some adjusted stats.

## Interior

The interior of the **Maple Syrup Launcher** is simple and largely identical to its regular counterpart, featuring only a pilot's seat and a team-colored dashboard.

## Advantages

- Can deal massive amounts of hull damage with its 8 small torpedoes.
- Has more health, more maneuverability, more torpedoes, and more powerful turrets than its counterpart.

## Disadvantages

- Relatively slow and unwieldy for a Battlecruiser, even with its buffed stats.
- The limited nature of this ship, as well as its bright colors, can make it a prime target.
- Its DPS relies heavily on its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). Since torpedoes are relatively slow, this makes hitting fast targets difficult.

## Strategy

- Use this ship against large, slow targets or at close range to maximize its damage output.
- Support ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) with high-accuracy turrets can be vital to fend off smaller enemy ships that are hard to hit with torpedoes.
