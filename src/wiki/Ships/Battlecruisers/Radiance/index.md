{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Radiance_** is a **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)** with a focus on [Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and high speed.

## Description

The **Radiance** is a long ship with a barrel on the front and engines on the back. The whole front of the ship is taken up by the [Large Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), with ridges on either side. The four [Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are mounted on the top, bottom, and sides of the center area of the ship.

## Appearance

Once you go through the main entrance (in the back of the ship) you will see a long hallway with two or three different rooms. The end of the hallway opens to a small room from which the pilot controls the ship.

## Advantages

- Turret placement leaves it with no blind spots.
- Laser and Phaser arsenal burns down [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields).
- Great as an escort.
- Very effective against pirating ships.
- Good maneuverability.

## Disadvantages

- Lacks anti-Hull weaponry, making it ineffective against hulled ships.
- Lacks long-range weaponry; can only effectively attack anything within 4000 studs or less.
- Cannot focus all Turrets on 1 target unless they are directly ahead.
- Slightly lower health than other [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Strategy

- Decent for ship-to-ship combat, provided backup is available or it can tank long enough to make up for its lacking Hull damage.
- Great for dealing with medium-sized, high-shield [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships), such as the [Zero]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zero), [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold), or [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra).
- Similar in weaponry to the [Dire Wolf]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dire-Wolf), the **Radiance** is more optimized for dealing with smaller ships, while the Dire Wolf can fight better against larger ships.
- This ship pairs well with the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing) as it shreds shield while the Razor Wing is a [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) destroyer.

## Version History

- 4 Light Lasers replaced with 2 Medium Lasers in .64d. Also gained 300 more shield health.
- Received a remodel in version .66n.

## Trivia

- Some may see this as an old ship.
- This ship is rarely seen used, even among new players.
- This ship was a fairly common sight in early galaxy
