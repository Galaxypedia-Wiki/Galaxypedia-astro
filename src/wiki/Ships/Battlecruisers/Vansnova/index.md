{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Vansnova_** is a [Spinal-based]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) PVP [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Description

The **Vansnova** is a PVP ship with an energy orb in front. Its firepower comes from its energy orb that is armed with 5 Large Cannons and 5 Large Phasers. It is a Spinal-only [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Appearance

The **Vansnova** has no interior, you just go through the cockpit.

## Advantages

- High health combined with excellent maneuverability.
- Powerful spinals.
- Can outgun most [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) of its class effectively.

## Disadvantages

- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Low HP.
- Can be easily defeated by other Battlecruisers if the enemy pilot is skilled enough.
- Only able to shoot from the front of the ship, so if other ships attack from the top, bottom, left, right, or back, the ship is undefended.

## Strategy

- Aim the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) where the enemy is going to be and try to get in blind spots.
- Always move in some random directions, as to make it harder for Spinal shots and Turret fire to hit your agile form.
- If you have a pack of these, then you'll be able to swarm and kill most ships that dare challenge you.
- Due to its high mobility, it can easily cover its blind spots.
- Try to drift as much as you can so that you're always going at top speed but never going too close or too far from your target.
