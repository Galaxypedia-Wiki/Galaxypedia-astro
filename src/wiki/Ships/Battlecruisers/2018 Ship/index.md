The **_2018 Ship_** is the first (and only) raffle ship in Galaxy.

## Description

The **2018 Ship** is a ship that was given out by a random lottery (raffle) draw to 10 lucky players. 294 players entered into the raffle in an attempt to obtain it. The main ship design features a glowing "2018" symbol, with other small details and a flat, wedge-like body.

## Appearance

The **2018 Ship** has no interior.

## Advantages

- Only seven still exist..
- Very fast.

## Disadvantages

- You will be targeted by those who see it as a prize kill.
- No weapons.
- One of the rarest ships in the game making it one of if not the largest target kill.
- The raffle for it was on discord, meaning you had to be at-least 13 years old to obtain it because of the Discord Terms of Service.

## Strategy

- Be incredibly careful while using this, as it is non-refundable and you will <u>**never**</u> be able to obtain it again.
- <u>**Never**</u> spawn it during a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Only spawn to show off to people.

## Version History

- Max Speed was buffed in .60d.

- Interestingly enough, while the ship is the only raffle ship of its kind, along with the [3d Printed warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}3D-Printed-Warlock), the [Kapisi]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kapisi), the [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala) and the [discordite cluster]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Discordite-Cluster), it is also dual-classified as a _[Limited Event ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)_ and an _[**Admin Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships)_.
- One of the few limited event ships available for one day, including the [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp), [Festive Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp), the [United States of Razor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-States-of-Razor), and the [Festive Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wyrm).
- One of the rarest ships in the game, as less than 15 people own this ship for certain, counting admins, devs and the lucky people.
- On August 8, 2020, user JustKingRuslan lost his **2018 Ship** when user EvilPleeber119 dove his **docked** ship in an [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus).
