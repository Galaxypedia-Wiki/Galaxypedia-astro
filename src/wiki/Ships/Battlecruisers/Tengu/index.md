{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Tengu_** is a [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) focused [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Description

The **Tengu** is a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) that can deal tremendous damage whilst also being able to tank damage fairly well with its large health pool.

## Appearance

The interior consists of a single corridor with several detailed display screens, ending in a pilot seat at the front positioned in front of a display screen. The ships docks from the rear to a single open door. Its exterior consists of several black, patterned plates, two large spinal launchers, and four engines. Its front end curves around in a manner reminiscent of past models of the [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse).

## Advantages

- Great Acceleration.
- Decent Cargo Hold.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) can all shoot at the same time, creating a high damage output if they hit.
- Relatively large health pool, enough to last a little while against a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher).
- More [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower than the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).

## Disadvantages

- The second slowest [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) to date.
- Vulnerable from most angles besides the front.

## Strategy

- Always try to aim for where the enemy ship is going.
- Don't buy this ship if you're not good with [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) weaponry.

## Version History

- Received a remodel in .61h(?)
- Remodel reverted in .64c
- Remodeled in version .66b
- Temporarily disabled in version Unknown

## Trivia

- Before the **Tengu** had its [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) removed, it was one of the only two ships in the game that could fire multiple [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) at once, the other being the [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon).
- The old **Tengu** model was based on the Tengu from EVE online.
- It used to have 2 [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and 4 [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), essentially making it an oversized [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade).

<!-- -->

- Its old design is fairly similar to the [Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx) and [Nyxesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion), using the same color scheme and material.

<!-- -->

- This ship was previously disabled and was "awaiting reductions." It was in this state for quite possibly the longest time of _any_ ship in Galaxy.
- Name is from a legendary creature in Japanese Folk Religion. They are supernatural, and take the form of a bird-man.
