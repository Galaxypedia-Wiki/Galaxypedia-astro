The **_MLMLRS_** is a joke [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) released during the [April Fool's Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2022).

## Description

The **MLMLRS** is a Battlecruiser that looks exactly like the [MLRS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MLRS), just _<u>way</u>_ bigger. It is [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-focused, like its regular counterpart.

## Appearance

This ship doesn't have much of an interior, featuring just a small cockpit in the middle of the ship with a seat the player hops into and 3 screens in front of the seat.

## Advantages

- Great amount of health for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Decent spinals.
- Works well for PvP combat if you can predict where your target is going to move and fire accordingly.

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable bottom.
- Very large size for its class.
- Low maneuverability.
- Cannot be rebuilt.

## Strategy

- Stay in the back of the fleet and kill any small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) that come your way, while attacking larger targets with your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Use your [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to attack larger, slower moving ships such as [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), as smaller [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) can evade your [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Go near targets for more accurate Torpedo hits.
- Try to siege hulled bases with this ship from 9k away with the torpedo's.

## Version History

- Added for the [April Fool's Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2022) on March 31st.
- Nerfed after the [April Fool's Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2022) ended, losing its massive spinal count and downgrading its 4 Large Torpedoes to 4 Tiny Torpedoes.
- Renamed from MRLS Launcher Launcher to MLMLRS in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- Before its nerf, it was the most powerful ship players could obtain for free due to the insane [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) count and Health difference from the other two free ships, the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) and the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm).
- Before its nerf, it had the highest [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) count in the game at a whopping 255 (251 small torpedoes shaped like MRLS Launchers, and 4 regular Large torpedoes)
  - At one point before their complete removal, the 251 Torpedoes were changed to no longer reload and could only be fired once after the ship was spawned.
