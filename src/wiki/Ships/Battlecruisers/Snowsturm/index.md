{{< notices/limitedShip >}}

The **_Snowsturm_** is a [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) added during the [2020 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2020). It was re-introduced during the [2021 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021).

## Description

The **Snowsturm** is a reskin of the [Sturm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sturm) that was introduced during part 2 of the **Christmas 2020 Event**.

## Interior

Please document the interior if you own this ship.

## Advantages

- Has one of the highest acceleration stats of any Battlecruiser, aside from the [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen) and [Acolyte]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Acolyte).
- Can deal massive damage if used correctly.
- Second fastest [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) in the game, being beaten in speed only by the Zhen.
- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Excellent mobility.

## Disadvantages

- Low [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) for a Battlecruiser.
- Despite its speed, it has a rather large size for a ship of its class.
- Being able to aim with the ship's [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)Â is crucial to do decent damage.
- 3rd most expensive Battlecruiser in the game, only cheaper than Zhen and Acolyte.
- Larger than its [regular counterpart]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sturm), due to it using an older model.
- Like many other quests, it can only be done once, so if you lose it, you can't get it back aside from refunds.

## Strategy

- Treat it as you would any other limited ship, not using it often to avoid losing it.

## Version History

- Shields increased from 1250 to 3000 and 2 [Medium Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replaced with 2 [Medium Ice Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .70a.

## Trivia

- This ship was re-introduced during the [2021 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021).
- The **Snowsturm**'s stat distribution used to be the exact same as its regular counterpart, the [Sturm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sturm).
- This ship's name is sometimes misspelled as "Snow*strum*"
- The first Snowsturm to be destroyed was owned by [ahmetkaymaz123](https://www.roblox.com/users/277029989/profile). It was destroyed by [OblivionsVoid](https://www.roblox.com/users/1948588581/profile)'s [Templar]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Templar).
