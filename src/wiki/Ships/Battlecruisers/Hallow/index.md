The **_Hallow_** is a [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) from the [Halloween 2019 Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019)

## Description

The **Hallow** is a fast and slim ship which resembles the [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen), as both ships are flat and have mainly spinal-based firepower.

## Advantages

- Very good shield health, rivaling some [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Very fast.
- Some [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) will have trouble hitting this ship.
- Very powerful in Groups/Swarms with good coordination, allowing it to defeat strong ships like the [Consul]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Consul).
- Very hard to hit with spinals when at full speed.

## Disadvantages

- Will be hunted due to it being a limited ship.
- Very expensive compared to other Battlecruisers.
- Requires good spinal aim.

## Strategy

- Use your speed to avoid other [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships)' [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) while you hit them with your Spinals.
- It could also be used to distract Starbases due to its speed, shape, and health.
- Play this ship like the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing), it can take down stronger Ships.
- Make sure to use the Q and E keys to drift and constantly fire your Spinals.
- Stay about 2k studs away from the enemy ship when PvPing so you can fire your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) accurately.

<!-- -->

- Effective in swarms.
- Use in hit-and-run tactics.

## Version History

- Received a remodel in version .66m
- Saying ":Cost Hallow" started showing the cost for this ship in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- Before the bug got fixed in an unknown version, ":Cost **Hallow**" would only show the cost for the [Hallowlight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hallowlight), this means it cannot be refunded before it got fixed, this has since been patched and now shows the cost for **Hallow**.
- Widely considered "OP" by players.
- Accidentally given 6/6 huges for 10 minutes (these are the spinals of the Prototype X-2)
- Was released again in the new "Limited Edition (Permits)" Build menu, in version .72f. It can be obtained for a D class permit (675k credits) + 2327 Sillicate, 1843 Carbon, 1272 Iridium, 14 Adamantite, 58 Palladium, 20 Titanium, and 20 Quantium
