{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Hyron_** was a support AA [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)Â that was focused on shredding small ships.

## Description

The **Hyron**was a light, yet strong Battlecruiser. It was used solely for taking down [Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) or other light ships. It was defenseless against more substantial ships.

## Appearance

The interior was very unique; it was bright and heavenly with a huge white screen as a navigation system for the pilot to use. The display of the interior is quite small and not easy to fit in, but has a very nice polish of smooth edges and parts to make it look good.

## Advantages

- Fast for its class.
- Great against smaller ships.
- Has decent health for its purpose.
- Has no blind spots. No ship can evade at least one turret.
- Cheap for its turret firepower.
- One of the fastest [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) in the game.
- Has good total turret **DPS** for a battlecruiser of **138**.

## Disadvantages

- DPS is more centered towards taking down light destroyers, frigates and fighters. Not great against larger ships.

<!-- -->

- Requires pinpoint maneuvering to aim all [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets)
- Has a small Cargo Hold for a supposed research ship.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship head-on against a skilled pilot, especially if the opposing ship has spinals or is Battlecruiser-class and above.
- Stay at a distance if you are not skilled with close-combat.
- Use it as AA in a siege group, just one AA ship ( like the **Hyron** ) can go a long way.
- When attacking ships, begin by angling downward from them to allow the [Gatling Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to fire - then, when the opponent is hulled, angle upwards to allow the medium flak to hit.

## Version History

- Added in an unknown version
- Removed in an unknown version

## Trivia

- If you look closely at the screen in front of the pilot seat, you can see a picture of Jeff Bezos.
- One of the communities favorite ship to use before it got removed, Which caused a lot of controversy.
- Has the smallest logged changes ever, with the ship only ever being added then removed.
