{{< notices/vipShip >}}

The **_Aeaphiel_** is a fast all-rounder **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)**.

## Description

One of the first player-submitted ships to be added, though the original model has since been replaced. A [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) which strikes a balance between its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), [Spinal Weapons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), durability, and maneuverability, but excels the most at pirating ships as large or larger than itself.

## Appearance

The **Aeaphiel** has no interior, you just walk through the cockpit glass into the seat.

## Advantages

- Decent all-rounder.
- Has a nice balance between [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull)
- Convenient [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement.
- 2nd fastest ship of its class, as well as being very maneuverable.
- High speed, small size, and good overall health allows the **Aeaphiel** to stand up to prolonged periods of heavy enemy fire.
- Great overall damage output for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), being higher than any other ship in its class with the exception of some [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ships in the same class.
- Turrets have decent damage and great accuracy.

## Disadvantages

- Must be facing head-on to do max damage.
- Spaced out spinals (2 phasers on one side and 2 on the other) make it difficult to hit smaller targets with full damage.
- Requires [Galaxy VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) to obtain.
- The most expensive build menu [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), being more expensive than a few [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).

## Strategy

- Use this against weakened [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), as your high speed and high damage can easily snag a kill.
- Attack head-on like you would in a [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) or [Lusso]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lusso), so all [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Phasers and Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) can hit the target.
- Avoid AA ships at the class of [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), their accurate firepower is enough to destroy this ship.
- If possible, use this ship in swarms against large ships as you can easily overwhelm and destroy an overconfident large target.

## Version History

- Light Laser changed to Light Cannon in .64d, shield increased by 150
- Max Shield increased to 2350 from 2150 in .65b
- Hull buffed from 600 to 1670, speed buffed from 145 to 200, 1 Dual Medium Cannon replaced with a Heavy Railgun, gained 4 Small Cannon spinals, now requires VIP in version .73b3.
- 1 Light Cannon replaced with 1 Dual Medium Cannon, 1 Dual Medium Laser added in version .73b3 (this was only revealed in-game).

## Trivia

- In .51a The Aeaphiel received a remodel from ARiNA_AZUMA. It originally had 2000 shields, 800 hull, 2 [Light Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), 1 [Railgun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), 1 [Medium Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and 2 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Has a similar design to the [Sentaliz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentaliz), also made by ARiNA_AZUMA.
- Prior to the remake, sometimes it would be difficult to enter the driver's seat.
- It resembles an old [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade) model.
