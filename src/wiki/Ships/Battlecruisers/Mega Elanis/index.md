_This page is about the Battlecruiser. If you're looking for the Fighter variant, see [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis)._

The **Mega Elanis** was a free [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)-class ship with surprisingly good weaponry. It is currently disabled. It is the only max speed ship with Turrets.

## Description

The **Mega Elanis** was a powerful ship with stats roughly between those of Battleships and Dreadnoughts. It is unobtainable and impossible to spawn due to a generation error.

It is a cheaply-made [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis) with another [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis) model turned 90 degrees. The arament is changed to 8 Small Railguns and you can even notice that the Mega [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis) has 2 cannons glitched into each other as a result of duplication. This shows the poorly made model which MAY have something to do with its loading error.

It was released during the [April Fool's Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2022) and taken offsale on April 2nd when the event ended.

## Interior

There is no interior on the Mega Elanis, you are completely exposed to the infinite no-oxygen area of Galaxy.

## Advantages

- AMAZING Dps for a Battlecruiser, and a single one can take down a Punisher.
- Good health pool.
- The fastest Battlecruiser BY FAR.
- Shreds Hull.

## Disadvantages

- Cannot be spawned in at the moment, rendering it useless.

## Strategy

- Use this ship when it gets released and when it does, swarm your enemies in a brutal frenzy!
- Go with an escort, such as a Carrier.
- Keep it as a trophy, since it technically can't have any other use.

## Version History

- Brought to the Battlecruiser Build menu for free on March 31st, 2022, at the beginning of the April Fools' event.
- Taken offsale with the end of the April Fool's Event 2022, while being unspawnable after that.

## Trivia

- Was poorly <s>made</s> copied.
- One of the 2 ships that was released for free on the April Fools' Event of 2022.
