{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Belvat_** is a shuttle-like [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) with a [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Description

Despite it having a [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), the **Belvat** is not well suited for sieges. Instead, it is a PvP ship focused on [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals) weapons. It also has unique bottom-mounted [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on its wings. The **Belvat** is a good hit and run ship against enemy [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), and [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters).

## Appearance

The **Belvat's** interior consists of a simple hallway behind the cockpit that acts as a teleporter and the cockpit itself. Inside the cockpit is a small neon display and a decorated pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- It has high firepower from its [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Good for taking out [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates), and [Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens).
- Well defended bottom.

## Disadvantages

- Easily countered by itself with another Battlecruiser.
- Vulnerable topside.
- If you approach from above, all the [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can hit, but it also gives enemy ships an advantage since the majority of their weapons can likely fire upwards and hit you.
- Slow [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), making it ineffective against small ships or anything moving too quickly.
- Hard to aim [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Low health.

## Strategy

- Some players prefer this over the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing) due to it being less common and not well known. It can also support more roles than the [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing). (i.e.: Siege)

<!-- -->

- Attack from above/below to try and get the jump on other Ships before they can realize where you are.
- During a siege, use the [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) against static or slow targets, like bases and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Version History

- It used to use an odd wield script resulting in offset parts. It was later fixed in the Version .52 update.
- Remodeled in the continuation of version .65b.
- Phaser count reduced from 5 to 3, interval increased by .2 seconds in version .66b

## Trivia

- Prior to version .69d1, it was one of the four [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) that did not require a gamepass to use in [Galaxy Arcade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Arcade).
- Its current model resembles that of a Quinjet, a transportation jet used by the Avengers.
- If you think about it, the Belvat is basically a very cheap [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen).
