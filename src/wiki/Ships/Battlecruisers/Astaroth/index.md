The **_Astaroth_** is a precursor [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) that is part of the Halloween Event 2019.

## Description

**Astaroth** is the cheapest [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019) Ship available in the market. It is a powerful precursor ship, despite being rather small.

## Interior

You enter to a teleport and takes you to a seat with a 3D holographic table with a mini **Astaroth** with a Holographic text saying "PROPHET ASTAROTH ONLINE"

## Advantages

- High DPS for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Fast and maneuverable.
- Rather small and low profile makes it hard to hit with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) do a high amount of damage and have a good reload speed.
- Spinal cooldown is fast.
- Good spinals for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).

## Disadvantages

- Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.
- Somewhat expensive for a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), nearly the same cost of an [MRLS Launcher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MRLS-Launcher).
- Requires good spinal aim for high damage output.
- Low health for an event ship.

## Strategy

- Due to its low health, it is preferable to use in swarms.
- Use it in hit and run sessions, occasionally annoying other players with your high damaging [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).

## Version History

- Added during the Halloween Event 2019 in version .66b.
- 2 [Precursor Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) changed to 2 [Medium Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .71b.
- 2 Medium Lasers changed to 2 Precursor lasers and 1 cannon and phaser spinals given in version .72c20.

## Trivia

- The first person to lose this ship was heartzhacker to Galacticsky3782's [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal).
- Has a green spiral wave in the front where spinals come out.
- Is very similar to Razor Wing in terms of turrets and spinals.
- Has the same turret design as the Disruptor.
