{{< notices/advancedShip >}}

The **_Zhen_** is a swift and [**Advanced**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) **[Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)**.

## Description

The **Zhen**has a naturally flat design, which gives it a huge edge in dog-fighting. Its four [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are [Advanced AutoLasers and AutoCannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), which help tremendously when it comes to fighting smaller ships.

This ship excels at being an agile PvP Ship with multi-role capabilities due to it's speed, and variety of weapons.

Most weapons will have more difficulty hitting the **Zhen**. It comes equipped with powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), carrying four [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and two [Large Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) that are capable of massive damage if you can hit the ship you are attacking.

## Appearance

The **Zhen** has a long and extremely thin profile, with detailing and shape extremely similar to that of [Nightmare]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nightmare). The ship mainly features a cyber-futuristic appearance; An extremely large spinal barrel spanning half of the ship, 4 Long-angled engines on the back just like its little brother [Nightmare]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nightmare). On the middle can be found the cockpit with 2 turrets beside it.

The **Cockpit** of the Zhen is a closed cockpit with 4 screens and a control panel, just like its little brother [Nightmare]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nightmare).

## Advantages

- By far the fastest and most agile [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), able to out-speed some [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
- The flat design makes it difficult to hit, allowing it to engage ships near [Starbases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases).
- High [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) damage.
- Shreds both small and big [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- Great at hunting [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) and [Miners]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), thanks to its firepower and large cargo hold.
- Extremely effective in swarms, a swarm of even just 3-4 can output DPS rivaling the [Prototypes]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes), and can't be destroyed without powerful ships with precision weapons.
- The [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) have a good range of 6000 studs, allowing engagement at a long range.
- Surprisingly versatile, being able to participate in long range sieges with the torpedoes while still effectively being able to dogfight with a variety of ships.
- Amazing against ships without turrets.

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable to [shieldbreakers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang), especially ones with accurate turrets, as the Zhen does not have much hull compared to its shields.
- The most expensive [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers), coming in at a ridiculous 200,000 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits), along with items like [Plasma Batteries]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plasma-Battery) and [Armored Plating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armored-Plating).
- Damage per second is reduced drastically if the pilot is not skilled with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- [Unbalanced]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) Shield and Hull Health.
- Its status as an [Advanced Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) makes it temporarily unobtainable from week to week.

## Strategy

- This ship should be used primarily for pirating large [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) and [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) since it can easily chase them down and score multiple [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) hits.
- In team fight situations, use this ship for sneaking into blind spots of bigger ships for easy damage.
- Turn your Zhen 90 Degrees from its axis then [Drift]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting), but with Z and C, this makes it much more harder for enemies to hit you.
- The Zhen's flat design will typically let you dodge most of the time, but beware of small turrets.
- Avoid ships with highly accurate turrets _(e.g. [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr))_ as they will easily shred you.
- Use the high firepower on this ship to [Dive]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) and chase down vulnerable or isolated Capital Ships.
- Also avoid ships that are effective in shredding shields, like the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus), as they will melt through your health quickly.
- Use this in swarms to take down larger ships.
- The **Zhen** is very good at fighting siege fleets made up of primarily [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), as its high speed will allow it to dodge almost anything that is thrown at it. However, you still need to be extremely cautious, as Dreadnoughts can quickly destroy you if their turrets hit.
- Primarily use this for pirating defenseless ships. Camp [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) and easily destroy underwarping or overwarping freighters, and use torpedoes on them while they are docking.
- Beware of any explosions from ships you destroy; Your terrible health will lead to a quick destruction if you don't pay attention.
- Immediately retreat from heavily armed ships that exit warp very close to you, if they hit you even a few times you may be destroyed.
- Know when to retreat, this ship is very costly for its class and isn't worth losing.
