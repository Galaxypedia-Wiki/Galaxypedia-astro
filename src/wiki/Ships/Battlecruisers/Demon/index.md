The **_Demon_** is a [**Battlecruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) that was part of the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019).

## Description

The **Demon** is a Battlecruiser from the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019) that is no longer obtainable. It is very versatile, with light Gatling guns to deal with smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) to Quad Advanced Medium Cannons and a Dual Medium cannon to deal with bigger foes. Correctly using its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) is essential as its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) provide little to none shield damage.

## Appearance

There is a teleporter in the back of the ship, it leads to a small confined area. The driver's seat is a red orb.

## Advantages

- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Relatively fast.
- Tanky for a Battlecruiser.
- Insane kinetic [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- Hard to see because of its black colors.
- Great maneuvrability.
- Can be a threat to smaller and faster [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) due to it having 4 Light Turrets.

## Disadvantages

- User needs to know how to use Spinals or this ship will struggle to destroy [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Will be hunted, due to it being a limited ship.
- Very expensive for a Battlecruiser, costing even more than some Battleships.

## Strategy

- Try to hit as many spinals as possible.
- Use the insane kinetic turret firepower to shred through [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Try to go below the ship you are attacking as most of your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are on top.
- Try to go against [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) which are hulled or are Hull-focused.

## Version History

- Added during the [Halloween Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019) in version .66b

## Trivia

- Resembles a lobster, reflecting the description as a "creature of the void"
- Periodically emits a spooky wail.
- First one to die was Spinny101's, which was killed by Deathunterz123's [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer).
