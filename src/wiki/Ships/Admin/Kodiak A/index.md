The **_Kodiak A_** is an [**Admin**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) ship that is occasionally used by [Galaxy Staff]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff) to troll newer players.

## Description

When spawned, many newer people believe the **Kodiak A** is as powerful as its regular counterpart, the **[Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak)** until they use the :info command to realize it's actually a weak admin ship.

## Appearance

There is no interior. There is only a seat located near the middle of the model where the pilot is seated.

## Advantages

- Pretty fast.
- Very menacing name, it can scare away a lot of newer players.
- The Kodiak A's model noticeably smaller than the regular [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak)'s model, so it is harder to hit.
- Starbases and NPCs won't attack admin ships.
- Admins can add admin ships to themselves whenever they want, so they are pretty much free.

## Disadvantages

- No weapons.
- Lowest health of any ship in the game, with 1 Shield and 1 Hull.
- Players that are familiar with this ship will go for it immediately knowing it's a free admin ship kill.

## Strategy

- Don't spawn this admin ship without being 100% ready to lose it.
- Fool gamma players into thinking admins are much more powerful than what they normally are.

## Trivia

- The model is actually smaller than that of its normal counterpart.
