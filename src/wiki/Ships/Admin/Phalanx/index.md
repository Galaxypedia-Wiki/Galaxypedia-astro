???

- Tank all damage with its absurd shield health.

## Version History

- It's health used to be overpowered until V6, having had 260,000 before getting nerfed to 5000/5000, before getting another buff with the V8 Model that gave it 900,000.
- The previous designs of this ship were the Ares, U.S.S. Enterprise (Star Trek: ToS), ASF Shiden II, and U.S.S. Vengeance (Star Trek: Into Darkness)
- It's V8 remodel had the most HP out of any ship in the game at a whopping 900,000 until the addition of the [Spectating Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spectating-Ship) and [Chad Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chad-Swarmer).
- Removed along with most of the **[Admin Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships)** in version .62a1.

- The **Phalanx** has had 7 different speeds: 1500, 500, 450, 425, 3000, 8000, and finally 40.
- The second version of this ship was extremely buggy, and 3 more fixes had to be pushed out by [oShadowWarrioro]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff) before he could get it to actually work right.
- After testing, a person from 0% [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty) who spawned this ship, if they accelerate while not in endgame, would have had 3% [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty) by the time it reached full speed in its final model
- The ship itself has been updated a total of 9 times in its history, despite being a recent addition.
