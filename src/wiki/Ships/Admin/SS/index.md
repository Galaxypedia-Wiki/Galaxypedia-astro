The **_ß_** is a personal **[Admin Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:admin)** between Admin Director 1_Fast and Developer (former Admin) N3vadan.

## Description

The **ß** is modeled after a screenshot of 1_Fast and N3vadan in corgi and arctic fox fursuits respectively.

## Appearance

The **ß** has a small platform under the main part of the ship for the pilot and up to three passengers.

## Advantages

- High speed and maneuverability.
- Many players will flee at the sight of this ship.

## Disadvantages

- Easy to spot and aim at with spinals.
- Unarmed.

## Strategy

- Use this ship alongside combat vessels so that enemies have trouble looking at the battle.
- Be fast, but not 2_Fast.

## Version History

- Originally added under the name 'Hmm...', but later removed.
- Added again with the final name, but was again removed.

## Trivia

- The unique character in the name of the ship is likely a method of making it difficult for the ship to be added/removed with admin commands.
