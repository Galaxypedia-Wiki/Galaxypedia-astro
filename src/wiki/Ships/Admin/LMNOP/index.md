The **_LMNOP_** is one of the largest current [**Admin**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) ships.

## Description

The **LMNOP** is a _[Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx)_ sized admin ship. There is not much known about its origins.

## Appearance

The **LMNOP** has a rather empty interior. The exterior teleporter leads you to a huge unfinished and empty room with the pilot seat and a "Systems Online" screen in front of it. Behind the teleporter you came from lays another yellow teleporter that leads you to what would be the fighter bay of a Carrier-class ship. Since there are no fighters contained in there, it's just a long empty hallway spanning the entire ship's length.

## Advantages

- High damage resistance. (90%)
- High health
- Its speed cap is the fastest it can be in-game.

## Disadvantages

- Has no weapons.
- Somewhat plain-looking compared to more popular admin ships.
- Very large, so it's easy to target.

## Trivia

- The **LMNOP** was a scrapped carrier model that was given up. The developer TeenTitansGoHomee found the ship and placed it as an admin ship.
