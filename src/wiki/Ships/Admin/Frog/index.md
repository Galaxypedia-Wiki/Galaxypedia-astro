The **Frog** is an [**Admin Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) that has no collision.

## Description

The **Frog** is an admin ship fittingly shaped like a frog. It has high health and maneuverability, but like all other admin ships is completely unarmed.

## Appearance

![Frog Ambience]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frog-ambience.mp4-"Frog-Ambience") The Frog is an Admin ship that looks.... like a frog.

No interior; its pilot seat is hidden and non-collidable.

## Advantages

- Literally impossible to hit, doesn't have a hitbox meaning its impossible to kill unless you nuke it
- A resistance of 90% and 25,000 shields and hull makes this ship extremely durable

## Disadvantages

- AI won't target you because it's an Admin-class ship
- Players will try to shoot you down regardless of the fact it has impeccable health because of its rarity and unusual nature compared to other ships.

## Strategy

- Become frog, fly through walls and into bases.

## Version History

- Added in .73f19

## Trivia

- Has the same ambience as the [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal) and [Abaddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abaddon).
- Almost immediately upon addition, was given to a translation developer, [Miru](https://www.roblox.com/users/5212890/profile), countless admins and was seen in Mega Base floating around due to the non-collideable texture and small pilot seat.
