The **_Eclipse_** is an [**Admin Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) that mocks the size limits of a "[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)".

## Description

The Eclipse is an Admin-restricted "[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)" that has no weapons but a colossal amount of health and 95% damage resistance. The ship drops no loot upon destruction.

## Appearance

???

### Admin Lounge

In the Eclipse, there is a button that takes you to a room in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) containing some chairs and the **[Admin's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff)** profile pictures in portraits. The lounge is above the [VIP Lounge]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Lounge).

## Advantages

- Excellent health.
- Excellent damage resistance (95%).

## Disadvantages

- Lacks weapons.
- Slow for an **[Admin Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships)**.
- Exclusive to Admins.

## Strategy

- Use the ship's high health and damage resistance to weather any attacks that may come.

## Version History

- Received a remodel in an unknown version due to its large file size/part count.
- Removed along with most of the **[Admin Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships)** in version .62a1.

## Trivia

- Meant as a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers), yet it is larger than most [Dreadnoughts.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)
- **[Admins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff)** are allowed to give regular players this ship on [Galaxy Development]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Development).
- The latest remodel of this ship was originally going to be a normal playable ship based off the [Yamato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_battleship_Yamato).![First
