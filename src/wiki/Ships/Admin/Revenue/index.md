##  Description

The **Revenue** is an Admin-only Ship. The ship drops no loot upon destruction. It has a damage resistance of 95% and a maximum speed of 350. Similarly to a few other special ships like the [Black Scarab]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Black-Scarab) and [Aurora]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aurora), this ship is shaped like a classic sea-based vessel. It features a long, pointed bow tapering back out from the center bridge. The ship also has a small set of smokestacks in the rear that connect to a single, finned thruster.

## Appearance

The **Revenue's** interior consists of a small cockpit with a pilot's seat and a small white "screen". The seat is gold and red.
