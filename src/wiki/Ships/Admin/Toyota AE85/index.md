## Description

The **Toyota AE85** is an admin ship that looks like a Toyota AE85 and has two seats; One for a passenger and the other for the driver/pilot. It has unique wheels and a nice looking red trail following it. This ship has been removed from the game.

## Appearance

The **Toyota AE85**'s interior looks like a regular car interior. The pilot seat is behind a steering wheel and there is a passenger seat next to it.

## Advantages

- Very high damage resistance. (95%)
- Works well with Eurobeat music (e.g. "Deja Vu").
- Very fast; even faster than the [Revenue]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revenue).

## Disadvantages

- No weapons.
- Somewhat low health.

## Strategy

- Make every pilot jealous that you have a car in Galaxy.
- Fly around at the speed of light dodging every laser that tries to hit you.

- Removed along with most of the **[Admin Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships)** in version .62a1.
- Added back in .73a1, with a reduction to its maximum speed due to speed restrictions

## Trivia

- This ship is designed to match and named after the Toyota AE85.
- Using Admin commands, you can use a different version (AE86 Trueno) of the Toyota. This model is made by [OChaosWarrioro]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff). (Unknown if this works: Asked for both AE85 & AE86 in Galaxy Development and was told it didn't exist 6/11/20) ![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AE86.PNG-"AE86.PNG"){width="265" height="265"}![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Toyota1.PNG-"Toyota1.PNG"){width="272" height="272"}
