The **_Halloween Ship_** is an early **[Admin Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships)**.

## Description

The **Halloween Ship** is an Admin-only Ship that makes for a great party boat. It has a dance floor inside that flashes different colors. The ship drops no loot or bounty upon destruction.

### Music

This ship originally played a song called "Halloween Ship Custom 1," which was made by Pavalix. The ship can also play "Turn Down For What," "Vindicate Datsik & Excision," and "Blue6 (Original Mix) BlueMonster." However, music automatically playing from this ship has since been removed. ![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Default-song-2.ogg‎-"Default-song-2.ogg‎")

## Appearance

The interior of the **Halloween Ship** is simple. It has a large dance floor and a pilot's seat in front. (pictures in Trivia)

## Advantages

- High mobility.
- High damage resistance. (95%)
- You can host large dance parties.
- Fast.

## Disadvantages

- Has no weapons.
- Can't automatically play music, putting pressure on you to pick a good song.
- People will target this ship as a prize kill.

## Strategy

- Lure players onto your ship and then drop them into the abyss by de-spawning your ship as they dance on the dance floor.
- You can make friends by letting them party on your ship. However, since you're an **[Admin]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff)**, you'll already be getting lots of attention.

## Version History

- Removed along with most of the **[Admin Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships)** in version .62a1.
- Remodeled into s0phied's [Egg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Egg).

## Trivia

- On Halloween, it played music but then a bug caused the **Halloween Ship** to stop playing music. It has since been fixed.
- Admins are allowed to give regular players this ship on [Galaxy Development]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Development).
