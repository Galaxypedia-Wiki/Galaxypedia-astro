The **_Pill_** was O_Zumi's personal **[Admin Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:admin)**.

## Description

The **Pill** is shaped exactly as its name would imply: It is a large green and white pill. The pilot's seat is invisible and located on top of the green portion of the ship.

## Appearance

The **Pill** does not need an interior to fly.

## Advantages

- Insane acceleration and turn speed.

## Disadvantages

- Low overall health for its size.
- Unarmed.

## Strategy

- Go fast.

## Version History

- Removed along with most of the **[Admin Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships)** in version .62a1.

## Trivia

- The least-laggy ship in the game, probably due to the fact that it is made of 3 parts.
