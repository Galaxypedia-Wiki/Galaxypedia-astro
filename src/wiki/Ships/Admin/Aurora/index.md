The **_Aurora_** is a personal [**Admin Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) made by Uglycar & Rekuri.

## Description

The **Aurora** was created to be a luxury space yacht. It is fairly slow compared to the [Flying Car]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Flying-Car) and [Revenue]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revenue), but is still quite fast relative to ships of its size.

## Appearance

The **Aurora** features:

- A gaming lounge.
- 3 Guest bedrooms & one personal bedroom. Each with their own bathrooms.
- A Grand Ballroom.
- State of the art furniture.
- A helipad.

## Advantages

- 95% Damage Resistance.
- High health pool.
- <s>The best ship interior in the entire game.</s>
- One of the most fancy ships.
- Good for spectating battles with the high damage resistance.
- Somewhat small ships like [Gryphons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gryphon) can land on the helipad when the **Aurora** is sitting still.

## Disadvantages

- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Somewhat slow for an [**Admin Ship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships).
- Easy to hit due to its large size.

## Strategy

- There is no real strategy to using this ship; those flying it cannot fight back, so the only options are to tank damage with your 95% damage resistance or retreat. In the meantime:
  - Make everyone jealous you have a "Ship" in Galaxy.
  - Go on a luxury space cruise.
  - Throw a party.

## Version History

- Removed along with most of the [**Admin Ships**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) in version .62a1.
- Re-added in version .68e???
- Removed again in unknown version.

## Trivia

- Most unknown ship---only 2 players (Uglycar and Rekuri) own it and it was missing/not allowed on the Wiki for a while.
- **[Admins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff)** were allowed to give regular players this ship on [Galaxy Development]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Development).
- Was owned by a normal player for a limited time.
- A miniature version of this ship can be seen in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).
