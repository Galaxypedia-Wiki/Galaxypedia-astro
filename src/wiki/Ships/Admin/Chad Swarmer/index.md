The **_Chad Swarmer_** is a popular [**Admin**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) ship in Galaxy

## Description

Very few people have seen a **Chad Swarmer** and lived to tell the tale. The **Chad Swarmer** is the pinnacle of Kneall engineering, these incredibly powerful machines act as elite units in the Kneall armada. Their large 'stompers' allow them to instill fear on all opposing ground forces; while their powerful Kneall heavy quantum rail lasers are able to penetrate even the thickest of armors.

Approach with extreme caution.

## Appearance

The interior is composed of an Alien [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) protection bubble capable of deflecting the strongest of weapons. Attempting to breach the bubble is nearly impossible, and will always result in failure.

- The second tankiest ship in the game, right behind the [Malice]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Malice).
- The only Chad ship in the game.
- The Chad Swarmer's menacing look is enough to scare anyone, even the strongest of [Super Capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).
- Starbases and NPCs won't attack admin ships.
- Admins can add admin ships to themselves whenever they want, so they are pretty much free.

## Disadvantages
