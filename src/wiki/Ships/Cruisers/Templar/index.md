{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Templar_** is a cheap, turret-focused defense [**Cruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).

## Description

The **Templar** is a Cruiser introduced in the 2nd part of the Mega Update with powerful anti-sub-cruiser capabilities. It is shaped roughly like a wedge and has similar styling to the [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse), along with a [Vanguard Coalition]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard-Coalition) logo on the stern. Its armament is composed entirely of turrets, unlike most other Cruisers.

## Interior

The **Templar** has no interior. An invisible teleporter puts the player into a small box inside with a black square that acts as the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Cheap for its armament.
- Powerful against smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) like Fighters or Frigates.
- Good for beginners, as no aiming skill is needed due to a lack of spinals.

## Disadvantages

- One significant blind-spot below the ship. Shared with [the dreadnought that it is widely thought to be a miniature variant of]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse).

## Strategy

- Use this ship in a siege to ward off Frigates, Destroyers, or Fighters when you don't have enough loyalty for more powerful options.
- Stay below enemy [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) to maximize turret line-of-sight.
