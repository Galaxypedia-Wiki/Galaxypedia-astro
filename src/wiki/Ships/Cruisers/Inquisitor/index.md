The **_Inquisitor_**is a balanced **[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)** with good firepower and a low cost.

## Description

The **Inquisitor** is a Cruiser with 2 [Light Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and strong [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) for its class. The 2 [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are positioned on the top of the ship. The ship strikes a balance between health, maneuverability and weapons.

## Appearance

The interior of this ship is very small and plain, contrary to its decorated exterior. There is a teleporter pad at the rear of the ship that leads to a small, windowless room. The room only contains a seat and a small note pinned on the wall that shows lordmoneymonkey's avatar.

## Disadvantages

- Low [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- Can be outmaneuvered by most other [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- Weak underside.

## Strategy

- Make use of [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) for full effectiveness.

## Version History

- Spinal barrel count increased from 1/1 to 2/2 in version .66b.
- Randomly taken offsale twice in (unknown version please add) with no explanation.

## Trivia

- This ship's description is a reference to the 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' series.
- The avatar depicted in the note inside the interior is that of one of the game's former Shipmasters,[lordmoneymonkey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retired-Galaxy-Staff).
- When re-added to the Build Menu after its spontaneous removal, it was implied that it would be removed again for an unknown reason.
- The new Inquisitor model bears striking resemblance to the Sacheen-class Light Escort from the Star Wars: Interregnum mod for Sins of a Solar Empire: Reborn.
