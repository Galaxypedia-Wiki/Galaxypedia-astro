{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Nova_**is a [**Cruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) class ship focusing heavily on [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) Weaponry.

## Description

The **Nova** is a powerful [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-based [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers). The spinals that are fired from this ship come from the left and right wings. It is mostly flat in shape, which can make it hard to hit.

## Appearance

The interior is nothing more than a simple cockpit containing the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- High [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) Firepower.
- Good maneuverability.
- Has decent health.
- High damage to [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) due to its laser arsenal.
- A good ship to support a fleet.
- Flat shape makes it hard to hit with heavier weapons.

## Disadvantages

- Very low [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) Firepower.
- Low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage, with only the [Medium Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) against it.
- Very vulnerable blindspots.
- Relatively low health.
- Slightly slower than other ships of its class.

## Strategy

- Make sure to hit with all [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Go in large ship's blind spots and harass them with your [Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Version History

- Received a remodel in version .67e?

## Trivia

- The original model had a large cannon on its back, which may have made new players think it was much more powerful than it actually was.
