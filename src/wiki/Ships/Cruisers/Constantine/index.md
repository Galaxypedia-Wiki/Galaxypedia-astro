The **_Constantine_** is a fast, shield-focused [**Cruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).

## Description

The **Constantine** is a fast, lightly armed cruiser that favors shield health.

## Interior

There is no interior, as the pilot sits on the orb at the back of the ship.

## Advantages

- Fast ship for its class.
- Gatling turrets are good against faster, smaller ships.
- High shield health.
- High overall health pool.
- Decent Spinals.

## Disadvantages

- Low hull health.
- Minimal shield damage without utilizing spinals.

## Strategy

- Use both the spinals and turrets to maximize the damage output.
- Since most ships have only topside turrets, get under your opponent and use your high turn speed to stay right below them, your pathetic shield dps will still be higher than your opponents 0.
- Decent for countering small ships

## Version History

- Remodeled in version .66d?

## Trivia

- Original Constantine model.
- The ship resembles the X-wing from Star Wars
