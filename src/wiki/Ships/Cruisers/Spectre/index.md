{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Spectre_** is a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)-class ship with powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Description

The **Spectre** is an uncommon [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)-class ship. It's oriented towards a [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)-heavy chaser profile, as its weapons help to quickly finish off the [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and deal heavy damage to the [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) at the same time.

## Appearance

The **Spectre's** interior consists of nothing more than a short but detailed room containing the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Powerful spinals.
- Good mobility making it a great escort.
- High shield damage.
- Fairly evened out pool of health between the shields and the hull.
- Flat size makes it hard to hit.

## Disadvantages

- Only has a single [Light Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Quite large for its class.
- Little Kinetic weaponry making it less effective against hull.
- Hard to use if you're not used to [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Out-gunned by ships with stronger Spinals or lots of high accuracy weapons.
- Loses to smaller and more agile ships if the pilot is unskilled.

## Strategy

- This ship has high maneuverability but fairly low defense, so exploiting the enemy's blind spot is vital.
- Use the spinals, as almost all of the firepower is in them.
- Use in swarms of many [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) at a time. Four or more **Spectre**'s can bring down a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with proper use.

## Version History

- Received a slight remodel in an unknown update.
- One Light Laser Turret removed in an unknown version.
- Received two extra [Small Phaser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) spinals in version .68e.
- Remodeled in version .68e.

## Trivia

- Old model used in the teaser image on the Roblox game page, along with the [Archangel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archangel) and [Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warlock).

- Has a similar weapon loadout to the [Guillotine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Guillotine).
