## Description

The **_Ghost_**is a [Stealth Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}stealth-ships) that is limited reskin of the old [Spectre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spectre) model made for the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018).

This ship excels at being a support ship for Sieges and Fleet battles. It is also good at reconnaissance of enemy fleets due to its fast speed and invisibility on the minimap.

## Appearance

![Ghost's ambience.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghost-ambience.mp4-"Ghost's-ambience.") The Ghost shares the same model as the old model of the [Spectre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spectre) with some key differences, these are: Parts being dislodged from the ship, making it look destroyed, along with a pilot helmet on the front. Near invisibility due to it being a [Stealth Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}stealth-ships). And an ambience that plays when you are near the ship.

## Advantages

- Great speed and mobility.
- Has high firepower for a [Cruiser.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)
- Practically invisible and difficult to hit with spinals.
- Extremely accurate and long range sniper turret.
- One of the few ships with 100% [Drift]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Drifting) Percentage.
- Medium Torpedoes have a long range of 10,000 Studs.
- Rather small size, and flat profile, along with its speed makes it difficult to get hit.

## Disadvantages

- Can be destroyed with little difficulty by ships with precision weapons.
- Low health for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) and non-existent hull, meaning you are extremely vulnerable to [shieldbreakers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang), especially ones with accurate turrets.
- Quite difficult to obtain or re-obtain due to costing an [E Class Permit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permits) and [Stealth Platings]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stealth-Plating).

## Strategy

- Use your insane speed and the ability to hide to your advantage. Stay in constant motion and drift around your enemies so they do not land shots on you.
- **Avoid** [shieldbreakers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) like [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus) as much as possible.
- This ship is good for Pirating smaller [Miners]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Miners) and [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters).
- Beware of any explosions from ships you destroy; Your low health will lead to a quick destruction if you don't pay attention.
- Always try to hit your spinals, they account for a huge portion of your DPS.
- Avoid going too close to a Capital Ship, as you will have a hard time hitting your Spinals and their Turrets will shred you.

## Version History

- Added in .65a.
- Now Stealth. Shield -> 0 Hull -> 1000 Gains custom sniper turret _(So cold...)_ in an unknown version.
- Replaced Space Pumpkin cost with [Stealth Plating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stealth-Plating) in version .75a27.

## Trivia

- Added for the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018).
- Used to have a cool particle effect that enshrouds the whole ship, giving it an enigmatic and mysterious like appearance.
- Known for being really broken and op for its class
- Images showing Ghost before it was made stealth is found below.
- Its model never used to be broken as it is now, Instead it was fully apart and was a little faster.
