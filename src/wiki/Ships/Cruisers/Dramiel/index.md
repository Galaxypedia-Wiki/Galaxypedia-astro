The **Dramiel** is a fast [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) with two [Flak Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and high damaging [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). It is one of the most peculiarly shaped ships in Galaxy, with a large nose-like hook in the front and sharp wedges on both sides.

The **Dramiel** has a very sparse interior with few decorations, apart from some stickers and small constructions.

## Advantages

- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Disadvantages

- Low [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- Expensive for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) class ship.

- You can only deal decent shield damage with the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Small blind spot underneath it.

## Strategy

- Make sure all your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) hit.
- Use your maneuverability to keep in the blind spots of larger ships.
- Use your acceleration to run in danger.
- Use multiple in swarms to unleash PURE SPINAL FURY!
- Use your fast speed drift close around medium-large size ships

## Version History

- One of the most obscure ships with many people not even knowing of its existence.
- The interior has the logo for Outpost Eighteen, a reference to the Outpost Eighteen Galaxy Group.
- The name and previous model are based on a [ship](http://eve.wikia.com/wiki/Dramiel) from EVE Online.
- It's basically [Razor wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing)'s brother because it's [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) capability rivals the Razorwing.
- One of the noticeable differences the Razor wing has over the Dramiel is that it also has 3 [Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) compared to the Dramiel's 2, Another difference that the Razorwing has over the Dramiel is that it has more Alpha than the Dramiel, (348 Dramiel's alpha, compared to 493 Razorwing's alpha)
- Just as good if not better at pirating than the Razorwing.
- It kind of looks like a smaller [Nova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nova).
- Batarang the ship
