## Description

The **Revenge** is Kneall limited spinal-based cruiser armed with 8 small cannons and 4 medium phasers from part 2 of the [Halloween 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020) Event.

## Appearance

The **Revenge**has a very detailed interior featuring a cockpit and a bedroom. Due to its small size, the player can only properly observe it in first person. It is a combination of green and grey, with a few pumpkins placed around. The cockpit has a medical kit, some candles, and a skull with a blue flame burning in one eye-socket, supposedly referencing the Undertale character Sans.

## Trivia

- To acquire the **Revenge**, you had to use the alien rift and teleport to the Kneall production facility.
- The only way to obtain Alien Parts to make this ship during the event was to trade with other players, as they were not dropped by event enemies.
- There used to be a framed image of ex-developer EvilPleeber119's avatar inside this ship, but it has since been removed. The empty frame can still be seen on the wall to the right of the bed.
- One of the few playable alien ships in game.
