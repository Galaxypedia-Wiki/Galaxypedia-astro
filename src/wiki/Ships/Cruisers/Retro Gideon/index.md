The **_Retro Gideon_** is a **[limited-edition]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** version of the [Gideon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gideon) that features its original model and armament.

## Description

The **Retro Gideon** uses the original model of the Gideon, with its 4 prominent blade-like protrusions on the front and back and the central bracing down the front end of the ship. It is more powerful and more well-armored than the current [Gideon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gideon), and was a limited ship that was part of the [2019 Retro Ships event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2019).

## Interior

The interior of the **Retro Gideon** is practically the same as the current [Gideon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gideon). You enter from a side door that leads to the pilot seat. Behind the pilot seat, there is another room that has a couch behind what seems to be a television screen.

## Advantages

- Very high Health for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers), surpassing even multiple [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
- Good maneuverability.
- Very high turret-based firepower.
- All turrets are on top, which makes it quite easy to manage the line of sight.
- Great AA capabilities.

## Disadvantages

- Extremely expensive for a ship of its class.
- Vulnerable underside.
- Weak against pest control ships.

## Strategy

- Be careful while using it, as it is a limited event ship.
- Try to stay below your target since all of its weapons are on top.
- Use its agility to exploit larger ships' blindspots.
- All the turrets are on top, so if the line of sight is blocked, you can rotate the ship to make sure they all hit.

## Version History

- Received a buff in .66b shortly after the event ended.
- Gained 3 Retro Small Lasers and 2 Retro Light Flak Cannons in [version .73a3.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Update-Log)
- Lost 1 Retro Light Flak Cannon and gained 1 Retro Small Laser (unknown verson).

## Trivia

- Was one of the Event ships that was put back on sale for the [Black Friday 2019]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}black-friday-2019) sale.
