{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Sentinel_** is a durable and versatile **[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)**, known for being disabled for over 1 year.

## Description

The **Sentinel** is a fast Cruiser equipped with decently powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). It has some, but not great [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower. It has average health for its class. The **Sentinel** has a unique shape to it, resembling some sort of weirdly formed pancake in a sense.

## Interior

The interior is pretty much nonexistent.

## Advantages

- High [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- Cheap.
- Quite durable.
- Good turn speed.
- High health.

## Disadvantages

- Low [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- Relatively big for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- Somewhat large frame, which makes it more vulnerable to lower-accuracy weaponry.

## Strategy

- Avoid being in the enemy line of fire and use your speed as an advantage.
- Use the Phasers to wear down the enemy's shield, then use your Turrets and Cannon to destroy their [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull).
- The high cargo and cheap price make it a good pirating ship for newer players with generally lower income.

## Version History

- Deleted from the game in ???
- Re-added to the game, received a remodel and loadout changed from 2 Light Gatling Lasers, 2 Light Gatling Cannons, 1 medium railgun(turrets), 4 Small Phasers, and 1 Medium Cannon(spinal) to 2 Light Lasers, 1 Light Cannon, 1 Medium Cannon for turrets; and 7 Small Phasers for spinals in version .73d6.

## Trivia

- Based on its name, it should be used for defense.
- Getting to the seat of the ship may be confusing at first due to no obvious points of entry.
- Was the first non-fighter class ship to be legitimately deleted from the game, until it returned after over 1 year of being disabled.
