{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Sixfold_** is a uniquely shaped **[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)** with high firepower but low health.

## Description

The **Sixfold**'s signature appearance and the name come from the six wings attached to its main body that hold turrets and thrusters for the ship. It has two prominent rotary cannons attached to the sides of the bridge.

## Appearance

The **Sixfold** has no interior, instead has a cockpit with glass that can be walked through. The sixfold has 6 wings on the sides of its body, hence it's name. The **Sixfold** has 5 engines, all with a blue trail except for the middle one, which has a orange trail. There is multiple glowing tubes going from the center body to the pods that house the engines. At the front of the **Sixfold**, there is 4 pairs of guns, which the spinals come out from.

## Advantages

- Great mobility.
- Extremely high firepower for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers), with 6 [Light Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) and 12 [Tiny Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals)
- Able to do a great amount of burst damage.
- Spinals are excellent against [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).

## Disadvantages

- Little health.
- Very large, allowing it to be easily hit and torn apart by weapons from larger ships, such as [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships).
- Subpar damage to [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Expensive.

## Strategy

- Even though it is large, it can dodge enemy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) easily at a distance because of its mobility.
- It excels against small ships with its small [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower. You can even hit with the [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) cannons if you are traveling in the same direction and aim carefully.
- A good choice for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) as it offers all-around turret firepower and powerful [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- It can be used effectively during a siege as a support and distraction craft.
- Use its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) against bigger or slower ships to deal with massive hull damage.
- If you can form a pack of these, it is possible to take down a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).

## Version History

- In update .62a? the ship got a remodel which added more decor, a second floor, and a bedroom.
- Hull increased from 500 to 700 in version .68e.
- Remodel in .76c13
- Shield Bubble fixed .76d28

## Trivia

- The Sixfold is the second ship used in the [Tutorial]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tutorial), alongside the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp).
- The old model was remade once before being added to the game.
- The health and spinals used to be the opposite of the [Lusso]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lusso)'s.
- The current model for the Sixfold was originally submitted with a [toilet](https://i.imgur.com/sAeheAx.png) in lieu of a proper pilot seat. This singlehandedly delayed the remodel by multiple months.
