{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **Nidhogg** is a fast [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) with powerful [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) breaking capabilities.

## Description

The **Nidhogg** is a fast [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) with [Shield-Breaking]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) capabilities. It can be compared to the [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) or [Lusso]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lusso) in terms of [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) output, however, the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) on this ship do more damage than both of them.

The exterior is shaped like a cone, with inverted wings on the end of the ship.

## Appearance

The **Nidhogg** has no interior. There is just a black pass-through cover over a small square pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Has very high [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Very high health for its class.
- Decent maneuverability.
- Balanced health.
- Large Cargo hold.

## Disadvantages

- Lesser [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage, though still good for its class.
- Quite expensive for its class.
- Rather bad turret placement.
- Both the [Spectre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spectre) and [Nova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nova) are marginally better than this, both beating it in spinal weaponry and cost.

## Strategy

- Stay in fleets or groups of smaller cruisers.
- While pirating is a viable option, it's much more suited for fleet PvP.

## Version History

- Added in .60d
- Light Laser swapped for Light Flak in version .65a6.
  - The same version made the point where the [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals) fired invisible
- Received a 3rd light Flak Cannon in version .66b.
- Received a remodel in version .67c.
- 3 [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) removed in an unknown version.
- 1 [Small Phaser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) removed in version .71c.

## Trivia

- Similar to the [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) or [Lusso]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lusso) in damage output.
- This is one of few [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) that have no interior.
- The barrels on this ship are still invisible.
- A highly seen cruiser since it has good DPS and can do a ton of damage to large ships.
- Commonly used by pirates.
- Current remodel is based off the Rifter from EVE Online.
