The **_Retro Sixfold_** is a **[limited-edition]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** version of the [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) that features its original model and armament.

## Description

The **Retro Sixfold** is a buffed reskin of the original [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold)Â model. It includes unique turrets and increased health and maneuverability.

## Interior

The **Retro Sixfold's** interior is a simple corridor with team-color stripes facing the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) are extremely powerful against hull.
- Highest average DPS in its class, surpassing multiple [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) in damage output.

## Disadvantages

- Large size for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers), making it easier to hit with
- Has to face the target in order for all Turrets to have a line of sight.
- Vulnerable to shield breakers due to most of its health being Shields.

## Strategy

- Be sure to use your spinals when your enemy is hulled, as they are your primary source of hull damage.

## Version History

- Added in .66b along with the [Retro Ship Event 2020]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}retro-ship-event-2020).
- Received a buff in .66b shortly after the event ended.

## Trivia

- Was one of the Event ships that was put back on sale for the 2019 Black Friday sale.
