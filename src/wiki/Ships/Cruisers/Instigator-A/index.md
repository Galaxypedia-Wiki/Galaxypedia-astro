{{< shipInfobox >}}

_Not to be confused with the [**Fighter-class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) [Instigator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Instigator)._

The Instigator-A is a [**Cruiser-class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) variant of the [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz)'s [Instigator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Instigator) fighter.

## Description

The **Instigator-A** is a large [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) based on the [Instigator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Instigator). It features two large barrels at the midsection of the ship, which is where its 6 [Small Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fire from. The rear end of the ship also raises up a bit, which is where its [Light Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) sits. The two other Light Cannons sit on the side wings.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Instigator-A** contains nothing more than the pilot's seat, which is situated in front of three glowing panels.

## Advantages

- Relatively high health for a Cruiser.
- High maneuverability.
- Somewhat powerful spinals for a Cruiser.
- Powerful hull damage.

## Disadvantages

- Rather large for a Cruiser.
- The underside is vulnerable to attack.
- No way to deal a good amount of shield damage.
- Expensive for a Cruiser; only the [Nidhogg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nidhogg) and [Atheon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Atheon) are more expensive than it.
- No Cargo Hold.

## Version History

- No logged changes

## Trivia

- Was originally added by mistake but the community voted to keep it.
- Was previously the only non-[Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) ship in the game to lack a Cargo Hold.
