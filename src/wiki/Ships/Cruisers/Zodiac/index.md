{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Zodiac_** is an alien-like [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) that wields long-ranged turrets, decent spinal armament and is durable.

## Description

The **_Zodiac_** is a dark navy, box-like ship with blue neon lights outlining its features. It is the only regular build menu ship that requires [Alien Parts]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Part) to build, however has a strong loadout that also has surprisingly long range. It bears a strong aesthetic resemblance to precursor ships like the [Astaroth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astaroth) and [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal), while maintaining a style similar to conventional ships.

## Advantages

- Turrets have long range of 6650 studs.
- High alpha damage.
- Very cheap, considering its strength.
- Somewhat accurate turrets, especially against slower moving targets.
- High total health pool.
- Good damage to both hull and shield.
- Decent speed.

## Disadvantages

- Horrendous acceleration.
- Hard to hit small ships from a long range.
- Turrets have long reload time.
- Main source of shield damage requires good spinal aim.

## Strategy

- Plays much more like a battlecruiser than a cruiser.
- Use in swarms against larger ships for greater damage.
- Pair up with a shield-breaker to maximize your combat effectiveness.
- Get to max speed before warping into a fight so you don't take damage while accelerating.
- Take advantage of the long range on your turrets to keep out of the thick of firefights that could be hazardous to this ship.

## Version History

- No logged changes (?)

## Trivia

- Has the Vanguard Coalition logo on the side of the engine.
- The only non-limited/advanced cruiser to have custom turrets.
- Due to the blue color scheme and precursor resemblance, the turret models are sometimes mistaken for the ones on the [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal).
