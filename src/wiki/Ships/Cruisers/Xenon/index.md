{{< notices/outdatedInfo >}}

The **_Xenon_** is a very popular **[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)** Class ship with decent health and decent speed. You will likely see this ship a lot.

## Description

The **Xenon**is a siege cruiser with good acceleration, and excels at causing high damage from afar.

## Interior

The interior contains one small room with a computer with a small online conversation on it, with a photo of Wiscyy's user profile next to it.

## Advantages

- Very high health for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- Good Acceleration and Turn Speed.
- Small size making it harder to hit with larger [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Very high range for a ship of its class, being able to outrange a level 1 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and many other ships.
- Insane long-range kinetic turret armament for a Cruiser allows the Xenon to be very effective at hull-breaking without needing spinal aim(4 Light Railguns and 4 Medium Siege Railguns), making this ship viable for beginners.
- Has a balanced health pool.

## Disadvantages

- It can't defend against other small ships very well.
- It has no platform to get in the ship, meaning that you can fall out of the world when getting in or out.
- Railguns have low accuracy against moving targets.
- Incredibly expensive for a non-[Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)/[Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) Cruiser.

## Strategy

- Siege low level or short-range bases from a distance with your Medium Siege Railguns.
- When in combat with small ships try to stay as close to the enemy as possible so your Turrets have an easier shot.
- When sieging a base of level 2 or higher let your Medium Turrets do the work while you fly around the base to avoid being hit yourself.Â If any [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) comes to defend, destroy them with your remaining [Small Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- The small size and long range of this ship make it dangerous, especially in fleets: it can avoid base fire and dive in to attack ships trying to despawn.

## Version History

- Max [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) increased from 750 to 1000, added one [Medium Railgun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Received a remodel in version??
- Replaced 1 Medium Railgun with 1 Point Defense Laser in version[???]
- Turret loadout changed from 3 Medium Railguns and 2 Light Gatling Cannons to 4 Medium Siege Railguns and 4 Light Railguns(the first ship to be equipped with them), Shield health increased from 1000 to 1200, and top speed increased from 120 to 150 in version .75a5.

## Trivia

- The ship used to be asymmetrical, with only one Flak Cannon on one side.
- This ship's Medium Railgun was temporarily replaced with a Dual Medium Cannon, but the Medium Railgun was restored on a later date.
- This ship can outrange the majority of ships, including some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
