**_The Vampire X-R4_** is an extremely fast [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020) [**Cruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).

## Description

The **Vampire X-R4** is a sleek [cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers); something of a _Formula_ racer in space. It has two small, wedge-like wings in the front and a set of four X-shaped wings in the back, hence the name "X-R4." This ship is also one of few ships in the game to rely heavily on textures for its model.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Vampire X-R4** is a simple cockpit with a display.

## Advantages

- Tied with [Stealth Recon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stealth-Recon) as the 3rd fastest non-[admin ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}admin-ships) in the game, excluding [fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), only the [Prototype X/1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X1) and [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp) have higher top speed.
- Decent damage balance, somewhat focused on [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Nearly impossible to kill, due to the combination of high speed and high health, especially for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers). This makes it one of the most powerful distractor ships in the game.
- Good damage output for a Cruiser.
-

## Disadvantages

- Expensive for a Cruiser.
- Relies on spinal aiming to deal any damage.
- Although it is maneuverable, it is easy to bleed off a large portion of your speed while turning and become vulnerable.

## Strategy

- Drift around enemy ships while firing [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Distract Starbase turrets at close ranges during sieges.
- Use the high turn speed to easily dodge turret fire.

## Version History

- Spinal count increased from 1 set of 2 Medium Phasers to 2 sets of 3 Medium Phasers in version .72e1
- One set of Spinals switched from Phasers to Cannons, top speed buffed from 296 to 350, and acceleration buffed from 29 to 35 in version .75a
