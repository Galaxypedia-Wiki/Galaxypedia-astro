The **_Icy_** is a remodel of the [**Cruiser Class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) ship [Invictus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Invictus).

## Description   

The **Icy** is a Limited Event cruiser for the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event 2017</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017) which is modeled after the [Invictus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Invictus). The **Icy** has a very similar interior and exterior to the [Invictus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Invictus); however, the **Icy** has an extra wing and 3 [Medium Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) instead of 4 [Small Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). There are also many crystals on the **Icy**, similar to the [Blizzard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blizzard).

## Appearance

The Interior of the **Icy** contains long hallway, however the floor as a surface is slippery, hence the name **Icy**. There are crystals at the entrance and a row of chairs leading to the cockpit with what appears to be two screens.

## Advantages   

- Good mobility.
- Extremely high health for a [Cruiser.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)
- Good firepower.
- Great against shields.

## Disadvantages  

- Can't do much damage to hulled ships.
- Double the price of the [Invictus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Invictus), which has similar statistics.
- Unable to pierce hull.
- Low shield integrity.
- Slow [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) reload time.
- Less total health than the [Invictus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Invictus).
- No longer being sold.

## Strategy 

- Excellent choice if you want to hunt down [Cobras]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra) since it has a laser arsenal which can destroy the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra) in seconds.
- Use as support for ships that lack Laser/Phaser firepower.
- When engaged, always make sure you are exploiting the enemy's blind spot with your high speed.
- Fight ships with anti-laser arsenals, as your high [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) will protect you from their lasers.

## Version History

- Added in .60.
- Received a rebalance in .60d that boosted [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) by 400 and decreased [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) by 100.
- Received an extra [Medium Laser Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in .64f.

## Trivia  

- This ship is a reskin from the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas Event 2017</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017).
- It's called the **Icy** due to the slippery surface of the interior, hence **Icy**.
