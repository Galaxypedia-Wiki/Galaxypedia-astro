The **_Arthur_** is a fast and powerful **[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)**.

## Description

The **Arthur** is a fast [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) with a very unique shape. It is a very balanced ship (in terms of firepower) divided into both [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and it has a decent amount of health for its class. It also has great speed and maneuverability for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).

## Appearance

The **Arthur** does not have an interior, and it is entered by falling straight through the cockpit into the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- High firepower if you can aim the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Decent [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement.
- Good turn speed makes it so enemy ships stay out of its blind spot.
- Good hull damage.
- Good maneuverability.

## Disadvantages

- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are key to doing shield damage.
- Can't use all [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) when firing [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Vulnerable from the topside.
- Weak [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health.

## Strategy

- If you have more than 4 people in your faction and a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) shows up at your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), the Arthur would be a good ship to swarm with because of its relatively low cost, high speeds, and good [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Only use it to support your faction's fleet; never go near a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) as it will rip you apart.
- Use it to destroy smaller ships and harass larger ships.
- If going alone, use hit and run tactics. Strike your enemy hard, return to your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) for repairs, and repeat.
- If attempting a 1v1 battle, make sure that your enemy is a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) or lower class. Use the **Arthur's** maneuverability to find your enemy's blindspot and stay there.

## Version History

- The original [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement of the **Arthur** had two [Flaks]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on the top and three on the bottom. In version ??? all of the [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) were moved to the bottom.

## Trivia

- Some new players tend to take this into battle alone, most likely overestimating this ship's power.
- The **Arthur** does not have a clear hatch or entry hole. However, the bridge/cockpit's roof does not have collision, so one can enter through there.
