The **_Atheon_** is an **[Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)** with five of its own custom turrets.

## Description

The **Atheon** is a small Cruiser with balanced firepower against both Shields and Hull. It is a very detailed ship with a developed shape and decorative trails. It can be acquired via quest by [Harbourmaster]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbourmaster).

## Appearance

The **Atheon** has a very simple interior; you enter through an oval cockpit containing the pilot seat.

## Advantages

- Great maneuverability.
- No blind spots.
- Classed as a Cruiser while having Battleship/Dreadnought DPS
- Slightly higher health, DPS, and turret count than the [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen), an advanced battlecruiser.
- Very good spinal damage against shields.
- Great for swarming large ships with many blind spots, like the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator).
- Turrets have high range considering the ship's class.
- Perfect for Alien hunting due to the [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) breaking [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) and [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) breaking [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets).
- Amazing shield breaking power for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).

## Disadvantages

- Very expensive for its class.
- Turrets often miss when fired against small, moving targets.
- Difficult to fire all turrets at once unless facing the target head-on.
- Small cargo hold, disabling the ability to loot large wrecks.
- Can usually be destroyed by precision turrets with ease.
- Weak to heavy AA fire from ships such as the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) and [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest)

## Strategy

- Quickly overwhelm the enemy when used in swarms, and target the blind spots of [larger or more inaccurate ships.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships)
- Because of the rarity of this ship it can be used to lure people out of their base during war.
- Be cautious around ships with precision turrets, they can easily kill you.
- Use this in swarms to completely annihilate shield tanks.
- Use the lack of popularity to your advantage, and easily destroy ships like [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) piloted by newer players.
