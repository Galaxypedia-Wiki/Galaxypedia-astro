{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **Orion** is a heavy Cruiser, borderline battlecruiser made by the [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth) that has very high health for a Cruiser, decent [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) damage, and light [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) in case any small ships attack.

## Description

The **Orion** is a slow [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers). It carries 2 [Small Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 1 [Medium Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), it is capable of good [Spinal Weaponry]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) use, but is slow for a ship of its class.

## Appearance

On the back of the **Orion** is a teleporter that leads to a small room which contains nothing but the pilot's seat. The current model is partially broken due to an admin deleting several ship meshes.

## Advantages

- High-damaging [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Decent support ship.
- Highest health of any non-event Cruiser.
- A few light [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) to defend against small ships.

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable bottom and sides.
- Slow for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- Not much [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower, they do not do much against capital ships.
- Lack of Flak or Cannon Turrets, meaning you must use its Spinals in order to deal [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- Large for a Cruiser.

## Strategy

- Escort larger ships for sieges and use its Small Cannons to kill attacking ships.
- Moderately effective against a single [Alien Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer), but does not fare well against larger groups.
- Use your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) to deal damage to capital ships, and your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to attack small ships.

## Version History

- Gains 2 [Light Gatling Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replacing its [Light Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Light Flak Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and gained 1 [Dual Medium Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replacing 1 [Small Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in version .75a3.
- Added 2 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) ("G" Spinal) and changed [Medium Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to [Dual Medium Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .65b.

- Has a limited version, the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Cold Blood</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cold-Blood).
