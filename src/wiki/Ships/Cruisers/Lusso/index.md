The **_Lusso_** is a speedy, luxurious **[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)**.

## Description

The **Lusso** is a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) with four [Light Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and twelve [Tiny Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). Its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fire like a minigun and reload very quickly. If you use the ship's [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) correctly with its [Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) you can do large amounts of shield and hull damage.

The **Lusso** is a fast ship with a top speed of 170 and a very high turn speed of 0.6. Overall, it is a good [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers), as it has good firepower and a great interior. Its only downside is that it's very expensive for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers), but still very cheap compared to most ships. If you are not good with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), you won't be able to do any significant damage to shields. This ship is great for attacking smaller ships. However, it dies very quickly because this ship has low health.

The **Lusso** also has many team-colored accents all around the exterior. Making it very easy to identify the faction of the player it's owned by.

## Appearance

The **Lusso** has a very luxurious interior, with various paintings, art-like structures including some classic Roblox items and even a relatively fancy pilot's seat, in a separate cockpit with even more fancy items and decor.

## Advantages

- Good acceleration and turn speed.
- High damaging [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Great for attacking ships of the same size or smaller like [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

## Disadvantages

- Low shield health.
- Lack of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on the bottom.
- Without [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) it is hard to damage shields.
- Somewhat easy to hit, making it hard to fight larger ships.

## Strategy

- Face your opponent to let all the [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) hit him while you fire the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Stay away from an enemyÂ [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase). It may be a fatal error without a strong ship supporting you.
- Work with a hull shredding ship for maximum effectiveness.
- Be sure to avoid any ship that is larger than it.

## Version History

- Small interior changes in an unknown version.
- Turret bug fix in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- The **Lusso** model has broken three times in-game and has needed to get fixed each time.
- The opposite of the [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold), as it has 12 [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) instead of cannons and hull based [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) instead of laser-based, as well as the exact opposite health.
- Formerly featured on one of the screens at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).
