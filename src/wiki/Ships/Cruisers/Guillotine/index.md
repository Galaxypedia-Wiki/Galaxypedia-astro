{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Guillotine_** is a [**Cruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) added in the first part of the Mega Update.

## Description

The **Guillotine**is a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) that was temporarily retired from the game due to issues with docking and the cockpit being not large enough for players. It was re-added later, entirely fixed. It had almost the same look as the [Scimitar]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Scimitar), but with more details, especially the spikes.

## Appearance

The interior of the ship is made with a living room with a bed, a sort of kitchen, a box of cookies and a coffee machine. Then you will be able to enter the pilot's seat, in an oval cockpit.

## Advantages

- Small and discreet, as it is mostly black, with some red lines and some red neon spikes.
- Somewhat effective [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Very cost effective.
- High speed.
- Great turn speed

## Disadvantages

- Very weak health compared to other [Cruisers.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)
- Acceleration is somewhat lacking.

## Strategy

- Use it in swarm to literally shred Shields of bigger ships like [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

## Version History

- Removed "temporarily" shortly after its release, due to many problems.
- Re-Added a month or so later.

## Trivia

- Closely resembles the [Scimitar]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Scimitar).
