{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Invictus_**is a **[Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)** class ship with massive hull.

## Description

The **Invictus** is armed with [Five Light Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). It has a total health pool of 2600, rivaling [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) in health. The **Invictus** has slow acceleration.

## Appearance

The interior is simple, being composed of only the pilot seat that has a joystick and a single passenger seat behind it.

## Advantages

- Highest health of all [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- Great against [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and shield breakers.
- No blind spots.
- Large cargo hold for a Cruiser.
- Great for support.

## Disadvantages

- Slow acceleration for a Cruiser.
- Expensive for a Cruiser despite needing only a level 1 [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse).
- Has no kinetic weaponry, making it hard to damage Hull.
- Cannot focus all Turrets on a target at once unless facing directly away/towards the target.
- Weak shields compared to Hull, and very weak to hull breakers.

## Strategy

- Excellent choice if you want to hunt down the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra) since it has high Hull, speed, and anti-shield firepower.
- Use as support for ships that lack [Shield-damaging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) firepower.
- In PVP, always make sure you are exploiting the enemy's blind spot.
- Try this when [sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}sieging) a level 1 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) since its high Hull won't suffer under the intense laser fire. Once the base is hulled, switch this ship out for a hull-breaker.
- Great for harassing the [Lazarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lazarus), a [ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) with high Shields and low Hull.
- A swarm of these could be used as a perfect counter to the [Zeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zeus), since they are good ad breaking shields and being sturdy against shield breakers.

## Version History

- Max Hull increased from 1300 to 2000 in version .65b
- Was remodeled in version .66b

## Trivia

- Looks inspired off of a fighter jet.
- The old model was reskinned as the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Icy</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Icy) during the [Christmas 2017 Event.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017)
