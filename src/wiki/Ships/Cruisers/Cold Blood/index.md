The **_Cold blood_**is a redesign of the [Orion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orion) made for the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).

## Description

The **_Cold Blood_**shares its base design with the [Orion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orion). Its color scheme has been changed to fit the holidays, with some ice and rocks added to the model.

## Interior

The **_Cold Blood_**has the same interior as the [Orion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orion). (Empty with the only things in it being the pilot's seat and the teleporter pad)

## Advantages

- Does decent damage.
- High health for its class.
- High mobility.

## Disadvantages

- Since this is a limited ship, it is often seen as a jackpot for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Once lost, it can **NEVER** be reobtained (unless refunded).
- Awful damage output.

## Strategy

- Don't spawn this ship unless you want to die.

## Version History

- Added in Version .65b.
- No logged changes.

## Trivia

- It is one of the ships to use the "Of course it has low health, it's made of <s>snow</s> ice!" joke.
