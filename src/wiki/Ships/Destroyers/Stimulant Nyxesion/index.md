The **Stimulant Nyxesion** is an [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) that spawned during the duration of the [Ultimate Retro Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ultimate-Retro-Event-2022).

## Description

The stimulant nyxesion is a pirate themed variant of the [nyxesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}nyxesion) with a slightly better top speed and maneuverability, but lower overall hp.

## Behavior

It follows the same pattern as most [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) ships.

Its spawns in 1-3 Groups every _???_ minutes and only does so on Public servers.

Behavior similar to that of the Alien Swarmer and Pirate Dragoon.

## Strategy

The stimulant nyxesion is a small and very maneuverable fighter craft. Use a ship with small turrets or flak weaponry to counter this.

## Trivia

- The Stimulant Nyxesion has a warp drive unlike the [Nyxesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyxesion) and [Spirit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spirit), and is classified as a [:Category:Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) instead of its respective class, it is also considerably weaker compared to the mentioned ships.
- The model this ship uses is a different from the [Nyxesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyxesion), and is instead an older model of the [Nixesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) that is also used by the fighter ship [Spirit]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spirit).
