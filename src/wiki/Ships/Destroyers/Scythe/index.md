{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Scythe_** is a **[Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)** Class ship commonly used as an interceptor against large targets getting jobs done fast.

##  Description

The exterior of the **Scythe** features four pillars jutting out from the cockpit. It boasts 4 four wings, four [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), and three Cannon barrels. It also has a purple trail. In terms of use, it's very similar to the [Scimitar]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Scimitar).

## Interior

The **Scythe** has a small pass-through door in the back with a cross-brace over it. This door leads to an opening in the center of the ship, which is decorated with the marble and gray style seen on the outside. The Scythe also contains a rather fancy pilot seat facing a neon panel.

## Advantages

- High [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- Highly maneuverable.
- Both energy and kinetic weaponry. (Energy does more damage to [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and kinetic does more damage to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).)
- Great acceleration allows it to get out of retreat situations.
- Can distract inaccurate base turrets with its high top-speed and small size.
- Great for outrunning fleets, hit and run pirating, or stealing kills.

## Disadvantages

- Lacks [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Requires good [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aim to be effective in PvP.
- Low total health.

## Strategy

- Stay away from AA (point defence) ships such as the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest), whose armaments will easily destroy your **Scythe**.
