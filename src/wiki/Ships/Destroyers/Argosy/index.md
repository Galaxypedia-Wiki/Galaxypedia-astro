{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Argosy_** is a hull-tanked **[Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)** which focuses on dealing hull damage.

## Description

It is armed with twoÂ [Light Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and four [Small Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). With this, the **Argosy** is able to deal a good amount of hull damage.

## Appearance

The Interior of the **Argosy** is that of a hallway leading from the back of the ship to the front of the ship that has the pilot seat and a windshield to look out of. In the hallway is somewhere to sit and a set of bunk beds.

## Advantages

- Very high hull health for its class.
- Good amount of hull damage output.
- Cheap.

## Disadvantages

- Almost non-existent shields.
- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are highly obstructed, and have very small firing arcs
- Slow speed for a destroyer, even below average for frigates
- Does considerably less shield damage compared to hull.
- Weak against anything above a destroyer.

## Strategy

- Works very well when paired with a ship with good shield damage output, such as the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra).
- Great for attacking ships within base range, as losing it isn't much of a problem due to the very low cost.
- The low cost of this ship, coupled with versatile armament, make it a dream come true for a swarm ship.
- The versatile armament of this ship coupled with its low price makes this ship an ideal [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) vessel.
- Shield damage is somewhat lacking even with the [Light Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It is extremely slow for a Destroyer, even some Battleships will move faster. It has almost non-existent shields, but the highest amount of hull in its class, making it very effective against ships that primarily deal shield damage.
- Diving bases wouldn't be the smartest idea, as bases could hit turrets easier with your slow speed.
- If aligned correctly, the lasers can break through shields, then the cannons can finish the hull.

## Trivia

- Has similar features to the old [Archeon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archeon) model.
- The model itself reportedly hasn't been changed or remodeled since alpha, making it one of if not the oldest model and/or the least touched model in the game.
