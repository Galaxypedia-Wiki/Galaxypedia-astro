{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Defiance_**is a powerful [**Destroyer**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).

## Description

The **Defiance**is decently fast [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) that deals very high damage with its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Appearance

The interior to the Defiance includes a small pilot seat with a small screen in front of it.

## Advantages

- High damage output for its class.
- Fast, maneuverable and small.
- No blind spots.
- The [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are in a good position to simultaneously fire with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Strong against shields for its class.

## Disadvantages

- Needs good [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aim to do hull damage.
- Slow for a Destroyer, as slow as many battlecruisers.
- Pilot must rely on spinals to deal substantial hull damage

## Strategy

- Used best to exploit the blind spots of larger and less mobile ships in order to deal the most damage without dying.
- Use this for diving weak targets, as the [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) easily shred hull.
- The **Defiance** is also useful for hunting [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) with its high-accuracy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Version History

- Added in update .65a6.
- Max Hull reduced from 600 to 500, Turn speed reduced from .6 to .55, Cannon barrels reduced from 5 to 3 in version .65b

## Trivia

- It has a light blue trail like the [Valiant]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Valiant).
- Its model resembles the Hercules from Star Conflict
