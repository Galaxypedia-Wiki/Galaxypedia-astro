The **_Patriotic Phantom_** was a **[Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** [4th of July]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fourth-of-july-2019) reskin of the [**Destroyer-class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) [Phantom]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Phantom).

## Description

The **Patriotic Phantom** was a limited ship that is part of the 2019 July 4th event. It has a red, white, and blue theme instead of the color scheme of the regular [Phantom]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Phantom).

## Interior

The **Patriotic Phantom** had the same interior as a regular phantom, but with different colored walls.

## Advantages

- Well-defended underbelly.
- Somewhat fast.
- Powerful against Shields.

## Disadvantages

- Exactly the same as a regular Phantom, except for the colors.
- Prime target for Pirates.
- Low Hull damage.
- Once you lose this ship you can't get it back after the event ends.

## Strategy

- Use the shield-based firepower to burn through enemy [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), then call in support to finish them off.
- Pairs well with [Hull-breaker]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}hull-breakers) ships which can make up for its lacking anti-[Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) firepower.

## Version History

- Added in version .65b on July 5th as part of the 2019 Fourth of July event.
- Removed along with a plethora of other Fourth of July-themed Limited ships in an unknown version.
