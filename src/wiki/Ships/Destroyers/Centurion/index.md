{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Centurion_** is a [**Destroyer**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) class ship and one of the few ships to be armed with [torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).

## Description

The Centurion is a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) that has a long chassis and short, awkward wings and a variety of weapons. It has thrusters hanging on its wings, and phasers attached to the front. A [Medium Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) rests on the bottom of the ship waiting to be fired.

## Advantages

- Devastating against [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).
- Fairly well defended against [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates), and [Alien Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) because of its gatlings.
- Early Torpedo Sieger for experienced players.
- [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) deals very high damage.
- Cheap price for its power.

## Disadvantages

- Very low mobility for its class.
- Vulnerable bottom.
- No shield damaging weapons.
- Low health.
- Medium torpedo has a long reload time.
- Very slow [torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). Hard to hit a moving target.

## Strategy

- Able to siege and fire [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) at enemy [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or ships and deal massive amounts of damage.
- Can be used to help a fleet in taking down[Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or large [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships)
- Can be combined with shield shredding ships such as the [Gideon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gideon) to make a devastating combo.

## Version History

- Remodeled in version .66b

## Trivia

- The **Centurion** was the first ship added to this game. (A lot of people think the first was the [Avenger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avenger)).
- The first and only Destroyer with a [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) if you don't count both of its limited counterparts.
- In the [Christmas Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017), it was reskinned as the [Viking]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viking).
- In the Retro 2020 Event, it was "reskinned" as the [Retro Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Centurion).
