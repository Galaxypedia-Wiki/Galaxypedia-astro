## Description

the Prikkit is a Torpedo-based small sphere-ish ship. This is the reward you get by completing the "Might of the precursor" quest.

## Advantages

• Very small hitbox.

• Very fast.

• High hull dps, higher than most cruisers and battlecruisers.

## Disadvantages

<!-- -->

- Fragile for an event ship. Someone diving you could be death.

<!-- -->

- Requires great aim/timing for the torpedoes.
- Costly for the power of the ship.

## Strategy

• Do not bring this for wars unless you are confident that you will not die.

• Despite having torpedoes, it is unadvised to use this to siege by yourself.

• Use the speed and small hitbox to your advantage. Do not move too close to the enemies

• Use it's high hull dps to finish off anyone that is hulled.
