The **_Meteor_** is a **[Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)** Class ship.

## Description

The **Meteor** is a medium-sized ship with no windows and little interior. You enter by falling through the hood of the cockpit.

## Advantages

- Decent damage, can deal with both shield and hull.
- Incredibly cheap, highly disposable and has a large explosion for it's size, making it great for suicide runs.
- Fast for its size, matching the [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade) in speed.
- Flat shape, making it harder to hit.

## Disadvantages

- Very fragile.
- Dependent on skill of the pilot to aim [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Large for it's class, roughly [Cruiser-sized]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- No turrets.

## Strategy

- Since this ship is very cheap, it can be used in a suicidal run with little cost.
- As with all other Destroyers, avoid ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) and [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr) as their high accuracy turrets will shred you.
- Don't get this ship if you can't use spinals.
- Swarms are very effective with this ship due to its great [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.

## Version History

- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) removed (1 Light Gatling Cannon, 1 Light Gatling Laser), 1 Small Cannon added, and received a remodel in version .69d.
- Lost 1 Small Cannon in version .72e1?
- Spinals nerfed from 4 Small Phasers/4 Small Cannons to 3 Tiny Phasers/3 Small Cannons, interval increased to 0.15s in version .72f1.

## Trivia

- Some people used to call this a Mini [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).
- The current model is a revamped version of the old [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova) model.
- The **Meteor** currently has the highest damage per second out of any non-limited destroyers, and is fourth to Permafrost, Viking, and Nightmare.
