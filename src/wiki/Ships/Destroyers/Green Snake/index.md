The **_Green Snake_** is a **[Limited Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** reskin of the **[Destroyer-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)** [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra).

## Description

The **Green Snake** is a reskin of the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra) available during the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018). Most of the ship is scaly and green, resembling a snake. The design itself is nearly identical to the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra), as are most of the stats.

## Interior

The interior of the **Green Snake** is almost identical to that of the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra).

A large opening containing several seats that line the walls, as well as the pilots' seat up front.

## Advantages

- Good [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) for its class.
- A lot of shield damage with its [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Disadvantages

- Has nearly identical stats to the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra), which is mediocre at best

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship as a replacement for the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra), as they have nearly identical stats.
- Never use it in war as its limited and can only be required again at 3x its original cost.

## Version History

- Added in .65a
- Had its seats fixed in .65 (Including the secret seats)

## Trivia

- Added for the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018).
- Between the **Green Snake**, and its normal buildable counterpart, the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra); the **Green Snake** has only 2 additional [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- There are 4 hidden seats on the left side of the interior.
