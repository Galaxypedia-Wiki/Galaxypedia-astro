The **_Retro Centurion_** is a limited replica of the original [**Destroyer-Class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion) added during the [Retro Ship Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2020).

## Description

The **Retro Centurion **is a limited version of the original [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion), featuring the ship's original model and a significantly more powerful weapon loadout.

## Interior

The interior of the **Retro Centurion **is made up of two rooms, with one room being a small bedroom with bunk beds, and the other room containing the pilot's seat. Both of these rooms are connected by a short hallway.

## Advantages

- Devastating [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage output.
- High health for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- Has a [Medium Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry), making this ship a good early torpedo sieger.
- [Retro Light Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) provide some protection against small ships.

## Disadvantages

- Below average [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Landing the [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) in combat may be difficult.
- Rather slow for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- Expensive for a ship of its class.
- Large profile for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers), especially broadside, making it easy to hit.
- Will be targeted more due to it being a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ship.

## Strategy

- Use your medium [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) to siege bases from a distance (10k).
- Make sure a fleet is protecting you during a siege.
- In combat, try to land your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry); they account for a huge portion of the ship's DPS.
- Avoid ships with high-accuracy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos), as they will shred you.
- Finish off crippled targets with your high hull damage.

## Version History

- No logged changes.

## Trivia

- Has blast wings attached to the side of its thrusters, unlike the current [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion) model.
- Has a pitiful explosion radius of 1.
- Is capable of soloing a [Galleon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galleon).
