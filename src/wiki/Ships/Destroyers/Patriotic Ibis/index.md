The **_Patriotic Ibis_** is a **[Limited]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:limited)** 4th of July reskin of the [Destroyer-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) [Ibis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ibis).

## Description

The **Patriotic Ibis** is a limited ship that is obtained in the 2019 July 4th event. It shares the same model as the regular ibis, but is recolored to have a red, white, and blue color scheme.

## Interior

When you enter the **Patriotic Ibis**, it's identical to the Ibis's interior. To your right is the pilot seat. There is a grey plate on the wall slightly to the left. To your left is a ladder and a loft with another chair and what looks like a computer.

## Advantages

- Very cheap.

## Disadvantages

- Prime target for Pirates.
- Exactly the same stats as [Ibis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ibis), with the only difference being cost.
- Once you lose this ship you can't get it back after the event ends.

## Strategy

- Do not use this, it is exactly the same as Ibis (aside from cost and the fact that it is a reskin), also suffers from being limited.

## Version History

- Added in version .65b on July 5th as part of the 2019 Fourth of July event.
- Removed in unknown version.

## Trivia

- Although part of the July 4th event. It was actually released on July 5th at night.
- Probably the worst event ship to exist in game.
