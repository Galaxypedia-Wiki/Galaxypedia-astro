{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Starfall_** is a [**Destroyer Class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) ship with a focus on firepower.

## Description

The **Starfall** is a long and narrow [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) with a large array of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinal Weaponry]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), which is balanced out by low maneuverability.

## Appearance

The **Starfall** interior has the pilot seat as well as a passenger seat behind it. There are also two crates in the very back of the interior.

## Advantages

- Very high [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) DPS.

<!-- -->

- Cheap.
- Has a large Cargo Hold for its class.
- Good Turn Speed.

## Disadvantages

- Very bad Acceleration.
- Slow.
- [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement requires you to stay above your enemy to get all turrets firing.

## Strategy

- Keep in mind that most [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) have [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on top so be aware to stay out of their line of fire.

## Version History

- Cargo Hold was decreased by 1 in .75a3.
- The **Starfall** got its HP nerfed from 1000/1000 to 700/650 in an unknown sub-version of update .61g.
- The **Starfall** was remodeled in version .66b.

## Trivia

- The current Starfall model was originally going to be a [Tango]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tango) remodel, but was then altered to be for the Starfall after realizing the model didn't fit the [Tango]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tango).
