{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Sabre Tooth_** is one of the fastest ships in Galaxy and is the fastest **[Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)**.

## Description

The **Sabre Tooth** has no interior and 2 uniquely-shaped wings on both sides. It is the only ship with these sort of wings.

## Appearance

The **Sabre Tooth** has effectively no interior. There is a small black square that acts as the pilot's seat, and the rest of the interior simply follows the shell outline of the ship.

## Advantages

- Extremely high Speed.
- Great for scouting.
- Extremely hard to hit due to its speed and shape especially for larger ships.
- Good [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields) damage.
- Strong spinals.
- Decent shields.

## Disadvantages

- Low hull.
- No [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Very expensive for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers); more expensive than some [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers). This isn't a huge problem however, as Destroyers are extremely cheap (except for some like the [Nightmare]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nightmare)).
- Very low [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) damage.

## Strategy

- The **Sabre Tooth**'s fast speed makes it very frustrating for larger ships to hit it.
- Use this in swarms to take down shield tanks.
- The ship can be used to scout the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), or in sieges scout what is surrounding the area of the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) that is getting sieged or scout what is surrounding the enemy base.
- Stay in your enemies' blind spots, or use your speed to dodge incoming fire.
- It has high shield damage, making it possible to hull an unprotected [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Punisher).

## Version History

- Received a nerf in .62a1 that lowered the [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) barrel count from 4 to 2 and lowered the speed from 300 to 285.
- Rebalanced in .62a1 to have 4 [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) instead of 2 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Remodeled in .65b to its present model.

## Trivia

- One of the fastest build menu ships.
- Was supposed to be a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) but was accidentally added to [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) class, and it is now classified as a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- Named after an extinct animal, the Smilodon (also known as sabre tooth tiger).
