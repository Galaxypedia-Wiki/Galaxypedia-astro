{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Lich_** is a hull-shredding [**Destroyer**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) with a lack in maneuverability.

## Description

The **Lich**is a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) with powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and accurate [Gatling turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) but very low turn speed/maneuverability for its class. The ship resembles a [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade) with a large barrel slapped on the front. It is mostly black in color with very few team-colored parts, making it hard to identify without prior knowledge.

## Appearance

The **Lich** has very little interior aside from the pilot's seat. The seat and cockpit are made almost entirely out of a tan, marble material. There is a small marble-neon screen with three panels in front of the pilot's seat, which itself is mounted directly on the bottom thruster.

## Advantages

- High [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) has high accuracy and fire rate.
- Cheap for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- High spinal DPS.
- High firepower for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- Good maneuverability.
- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) have good line of sight.

## Disadvantages

- Somewhat low health for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).

## Strategy

- Fire [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) as often as possible to maximize damage.
- Avoid ships with high rate of fire [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) like the [Bastion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bastion) or [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos).
- Low overall health.
