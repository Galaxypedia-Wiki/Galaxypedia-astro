The **_Golden Viper_** is a limited reskin of the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) released as a [**Destroyer**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) during the Black Friday Event 2020.

## Description

The **Golden Viper** is, as the name suggests, a golden recolor of the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper). Like the [Patriotic Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Viper), it sports torpedoes with a unique mesh and trail at the front of the ship. According to the description of the ship, it is these torpedoes that give the ship its [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) classification.

## Interior

For the most part, the **Golden Viper** has the same interior as its regular counterpart. That being said, it does feature some minor differences, such as a red metallic seat and a decal as the screen.

## Advantages

- Contains 2 [Small Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- High Acceleration and Turn Speed
- Very fast for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- High Hull health.

## Disadvantages

- Unlike its [regular counterpart]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper), it is a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- Very expensive for a ship of its class.
- Much slower than the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper), its regular counterpart.
- Low shield, making it weaker to hull breakers.
- The second torpedo is delayed after the first, which may throw off your aim.

## Strategy

- <s>Flex your wealth with this ship.</s>
- Try to avoid ships like the [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr) that are equipped for destroying small ships.
- Use the long range of the torpedoes during a [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) or when swarming large ships.
- Utilize the ships impressive speed for evasion.
- While it can be devastating in swarms, it's probably not worth risking this ship unless if you're confident that you'll make it out alive.

## Version History

- Received a recolor in version .69e.
