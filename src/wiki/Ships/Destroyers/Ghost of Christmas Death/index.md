## Description

The **Ghost of Christmas Death**shares its general design with the [Phantom]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Phantom). Its color scheme has been changed to fit the holiday and it now has sleigh rails under it.

## Interior

The **Ghost of Christmas Death**has gotten a holiday-themed interior with a fireplace, beds, and memes.

## Advantages

- High damage.
- Good maneuverability.
- High health for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).

## Trivia

- It has memes from the defunct Galaxy Memes Page.
- One of the memes found in the interior was actually made by a young [DylanTheVillain101]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}DylanTheVillain101). It was a Galaxy "heart pacing faster" meme created years before he would become staff. It would later be repurposed as one of many possible images displaying around [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).
- One of the two ships in its event to have unique [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) types.
- It is also one of the few ships in Galaxy to still use the Classic Turret designs in some way.
- The **Ghost of Christmas Death** was added to the game after the rest of the Event Ships.
- It is one of the ships to use the "Of course it has low health, it's made of snow!" joke.
