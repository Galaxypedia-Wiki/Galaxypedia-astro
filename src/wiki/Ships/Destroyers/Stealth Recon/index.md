{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Stealth Recon_** is a stealth [destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) that is the smallest ship to be equipped with a sniper turret.

## Overview

The **_Stealth Recon_** is the smallest stealth ship in the game. It is extremely fast and is equipped with a sniper turret.

This ship excels at being a support ship for Sieges and Fleet battles due to its long range turret and torpedo, as well as having high [alpha damage]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) for its class. Being in its name, it is also good at reconnaissance of enemy fleets due to its fast speed and invisibility on the minimap.

## Appearance

The Stealth Recon is a [Stealth Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}stealth-ships), making it's model appear transparent, being nearly invisible in plain sight. The shape of the ship looks similar to [Halo Ships](https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/UNSC_Starship) with a long, detailed and slim model. The sniper turret under the ship is extremely large and half the size of the ship.

There is no interior, it is simply a seat that can be accessed from a hatch on top of the ship.

## Advantages

- High alpha damage, despite only being a [destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- Extremely long range with the spinals and turret.
- Extremely fast, small size, along with its transparency allows it to evade incoming fire.
- Cannot be seen on the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) because it is a [Stealth Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}stealth-ships).
- Lowest detection range of any ship in game.

## Disadvantages

- Very small total health pool for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)
- Its torpedo, which is its only source of hull-based damage, is difficult to aim.
- Can be easily hit by point-defense turrets, such as PDLs and Flaks.
- Slow acceleration for its top speed.
- Rather sluggish.
- Sniper turret has a long reload time.
- Non-existent cargo hold.
- Expensive for its class, requiring 2 [Stealth Plating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stealth-Plating) to build.

## Strategy

- Use this ship to harass larger ships with heavy weaponry, such as the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement), or to lead AI ships away from firing at your base.
- Avoid ships such as the [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron), which are primarily point-defense based, and can somewhat match your speed to keep in range. As well as this, be cautious around heavy point-defense ships such as the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest).
- With its low detection range and invisibility from the minimap, this ship can be used in its namesake, for reconnaissance.
- Make sure to never stop moving, as a ship, whether AI controlled or piloted by a player, could easily destroy you in a single volley. If not in immediate danger, slow down slightly to help your sniper turret's accuracy, but never completely stop.
- Use in swarms to slowly yet effectively siege enemy planets or [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase)[s]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) by utilizing the sniper turret's long range of 7,000 studs.
- Whenever you must make an escape from combat; Warp far into empty space _(but not near the map borders)_ to make your position unpredictable to any enemies that may try to chase you. Note that this strategy may not work well if there is a spy on your team.

## Version History

- Gained a second tiny torpedo in version .75a5
