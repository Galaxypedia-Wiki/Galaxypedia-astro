The **_Patriotic Defiance_**is a **[Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships)** 4th of July reskin of the [Defiance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Defiance).

## Description

The **Patriotic Defiance** is an event re-skin of the [Defiance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Defiance) for the [2019 4th of July event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fourth-of-july-2019). It is a powerful Destroyer that deals very high damage with its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). It has the same exterior as the normal Defiance, but is instead mostly white with red and blue details to make it look patriotic.

## Appearance

The **Patriotic Defiance** shares its interior with its regular counterpart, but with a revamped red, white, and blue color scheme.

## Advantages

- High damage output for its class.
- Fast, maneuverable, and small.
- No blind spots.
- The [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are in a good position to simultaneously fire with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Disadvantages

- Needs good [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aim to do hull damage.
- Somewhat slow for a Destroyer, rivaling some Battlecruisers.
- If lost after the event you won't be able to get it back.

## Strategy

- Go for larger ships or [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) based ships as you cannot deal with ships that use [Light Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Make sure to exploit the blind spots of larger and less mobile ships in order to deal the most damage without dying.
- The **Patriotic Defiance** is also useful for hunting [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) with its many high-accuracy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Version History

- Added in version .65b on July 5th as part of the 2019 Fourth of July event.
- Removed along with most other reskin ships in (unknown version please add).

## Trivia

- It has 100 more hull than the [Defiance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Defiance).
- Could be mistaken for the Maple ships due to its design not having much blue on it.
