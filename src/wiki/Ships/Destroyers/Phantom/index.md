{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Phantom_** is cheap **[Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)** with powerful shield damage.

## Description

The Phantom usually is chosen as a secondary starter ship over the [Corvid]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Corvid). It is good for staying at the side of ships or going on top of ships because its [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement works poorly when chasing ships, or when exploiting blind spots. It has two [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) which can make up for the poor turret placement. The Phantom also has a health pool of 1150, with 900 [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and 250 [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).

## Appearance

The interior of the Phantom is surprisingly complex for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers). Upon entering, you will be greeted with three chairs in front of you. On your right, a terminal encrypted with odd messages and such.

At the cockpit, there is another terminal with a blank screen and the driver's chair.
