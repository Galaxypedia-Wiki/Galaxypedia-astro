{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Leecher_** is a decently fast and heavily armed [**Destroyer**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).

## Description

The **Leecher** is a small [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) with decent maneuverability and a high potential for damage. It comes [Gatling lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), as well as [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), allowing it to quickly damage both the [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) of a ship. It has two large wings with mounted thrusters, and has wing-mounted [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) arranged in a similar fashion to the [Archangel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archangel).

## Appearance

The interior of the **Leecher** is entirely comprised of its small cockpit. The only object inside the cockpit is a small, black pilot's seat with little detail.

## Advantages

- Both [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) allow for adaptable damage.
- Can do high damage to both shield and hull against ships either of equal or smaller size.
- Cheap for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- Great for hunting [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens).

## Disadvantages

- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) are mounted on the bottom, limiting their ability to fire on ships approaching from above.
- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are hard to aim.
- Below average top speed for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers). Which in certain cases, it can be easily chased and destroyed.
- Fragile health and light weapon fire-power make it easily out-gunned by bigger ships.
- The [Defiance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Defiance) and [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra) are superior options in all stats, though it is a suitable starter ship.
- Extremely slow acceleration

## Strategy

- Use the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to quickly eat through enemy health. This can be especially effective with the support of other ships.
- Move constantly to avoid being hit by enemy fire.
- Avoid ships like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest) whose high accuracy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can quickly destroy even the smallest and fastest of [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Outside of combat, it's a great ship for hunting down [Alien Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), but **ALWAYS** avoid the [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) for obvious reasons.

## Version History

- Massively nerfed in .62d7, reducing its health from 600 [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) to 350 of each. The Speed was nerfed from 210 to 140 and the Acceleration dropped from 30 to 11. It also lost one [Phaser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), and cost was dropped by a large amount.
- Remodel by Auri#1814 .75a12

## Trivia

- Has 5 forward-facing spotlights, 3 small and 2 large. Theoretically used for looking through debris or asteroid fields.
- A fleet of these ships have destroyed a [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1).
