{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Ibis_** is a cheap and well-armed **[Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)** commonly seen in Galaxy.

## Description

The **Ibis** is a very small [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) and one of the cheapest ships in its class. It looks almost comical due to the numerous [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) mounted on its small frame.

## Appearance

The interior is compact but detailed with the main control seat and a raised secondary seat in the back.

## Advantages

- Lots of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) for its class and size.
- Extremely cheap.
- Deals high hull damage.
- Good support ship against small vessels.
- Great against [Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer).

## Disadvantages

- Low shield damage.
- Poor turn speed.
- Low top speed for its class.
- Lacks [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Very short range.
- Can't significantly damage [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) or higher classes.

## Strategy

- Generally used take out [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) or other [Destroyers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers), as its small turrets don't deal much damage to larger ships.
- Keep your opponent on your right side so that the [Gatling Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) has a clear line of sight. Otherwise, you'll have an even harder time breaking their shield.
- Great ship for swarms, due to its very low cost and high accuracy.

## Version History

- [Light Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) changed to [Light Gatling Laser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in (???).
- Explosion radius lowered from 40 to 1 in .64d.
- Got a remodel and rework in (???). [ May 2022 ]

## Trivia

- The first model's design was directly copied from the [Ibis](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ibis) in EVE Online.
- The first model was also known for being buggy sometimes, which made users not use this ship as much if not at all; All though, after the remodel of the ship it was no longer buggy and was actually usable.
- Back in beta, if you killed it you'd receive 54 bounty.
