{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Cobra_** is a **[Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)** Class Ship with very high offensive capabilities.

## Description

This ship is a very good choice for beginners. The exterior of the **Cobra** features two jets, four fins, a heavy armor plating, and rapid-fire phasers.

## Appearance

The interior contains ten seats for transporting passengers and a pilot control panel.

## Advantages

- Excellent overall firepower and [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement.
- Quite fast for its size and class.
- One of the best choices as a starting ship.
- Extremely deadly to shield based ships; its [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) does massive damage and has a short reload speed.
- Able to get to blind spots quickly.

## Disadvantages

- Low Hull.
- Due to most of the health belonging in shields, the **Cobra** is more vulnerable to enemy ships with mostly or all laser weapons, like the [Bastion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bastion).
- Does significantly less damage to hull than shields, though still considerable.
- Rather large for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers), having the tendency to get hit by bigger turrets often.

## Strategy

- This ship is excellent to deploy as a counterattack in a siege.
- Can easily maneuver to the underside of a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) or any class above it to avoid incoming fire.

<!-- -->

- Try to use the ship's speed to outmaneuver and dodge incoming fire because of its low health pool.

## Trivia

- This ship was originally based off a transport ship built by hamma1.
- Appears similar to the Overlord transport ship from Kill-zone.
- The name "Cobra" might have come from the creator's username.
- When a cobra attempts to dock at [Aqueous II]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous-II) it's wing will get stuck on the platform and will not dock.
- One of the last ships in the game that still have a model that was created when the game was in alpha.
- Has a limited counterpart, the [Green Snake]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Green-Snake).
