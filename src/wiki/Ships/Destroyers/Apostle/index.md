{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Apostle_**is a**[Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)**with surprisingly powerful weaponry.

## Description

The **Apostle** is a good pirating ship armed with several [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It is also relatively fast for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) with good [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) and [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields) for its class.

## Advantages

- Has powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) for both [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields) and [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull).
- Relatively high top speed.
- High turn speed.
- Despite the ship's description saying it lacks many defensive capabilities, it has high health.
- Overall balanced damage between [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) (better [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) breaking [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals) but more [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) damaging [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets)).

## Disadvantages

- Very vulnerable to [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) with large amounts of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) such as the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos).
- Has poor [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement, with turrets on the bottom of the ship.
- Vulnerable top side

## Strategy

- Get a large group of these and use them to swarm larger targets.
- Warp near isolated [miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) and dispatch them as soon as possible.
- Avoid approaching an enemy [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) alone.
- Stay above your enemy so your turrets can hit along with your spinals.

## Version History

- Max Shield reduced from 880 to 800, spinal barrels reduced from 6/3 to 4/2 in version .66b.

## Trivia

- Oddly enough, the in-game description describes this [ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) as a glass cannon, but it has more health than some Cruisers.
- It has a similar design to the [1](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sith_fighter) Sith Fighter from the Old Republic Era in the Star Wars lore.
