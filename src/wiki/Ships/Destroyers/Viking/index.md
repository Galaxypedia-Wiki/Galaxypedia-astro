The **_Viking_** is a [**Limited Event**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) reskin of the [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion).

## Description

The **Viking** is a Limited Event ship for the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Christmas 2017 Event</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017) which was modeled after the [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion). The outside is an ice-blue color with many blue ice shards protruding from various parts of the ship. (Has a nice beard as well).

## Interior

The interior is the old [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion) interior but blue and icy.

## Advantages

- High hull damage.
- It has a Medium [Torpedo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) for sieges and that can do high damage.
- [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement ensures no blind spots.
- It has very high health for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) class ship.

## Disadvantages

- Very slow for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers)-class.
- Torpedo is difficult to aim.
- Low [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.
- Expensive for a Destroyer.

## Strategy

- Fire [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) from outside of the base range. Medium-sized Torpedoes can hit from a range of 10000.
- Useful in fleets for helping to destroy bases and ships.
- Chase down [hulled]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) ships and use your high-damage [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to finish them off.

## Version History

- Shortly after .60 was released, this ship got a remodel.
- ".61+" saw the replacement of 2 of the 4 Light Flak Cannons with 2 Light Cannons.
- Buffed in .64f to have a total of 4 Light Cannons and replaced Light Flak Cannons with 2 Medium Flak Cannons.

## Trivia

- This ship was made for the Christmas Event 2017.
- The name **Viking** may be attributed to the offense-oriented design of the ship.
- **Vikings** were warriors from Scandinavia that are best known for arriving in slim boats with carved figureheads and wreaking havoc across Europe.
- For a limited period of time after the Christmas Event 2017, the ship was able to be built for nearly half of its original value (the reason for this remains unknown).
