{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Corvid_** is a relatively large [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets)-based hull breaker [**Destroyer**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).

## Description

The **Corvid** is a powerful Destroyer with good firepower and health. The **Corvid** boasts 5 Light Railguns and 1 Medium Railgun on the belly of the ship, and 2 Tiny Cannons on the sides. It has great speed and moderate health, but due to its price, it isn't the best starting warship for new players. It is a really good option for when you can afford it though.

## Appearance

The entrance in the back leads to short hallway, eventually ending at the pilot's seat. There are also rooms to the left and right with a kitchen/sleeping area and fire extinguisher. In the middle of the hallway are some stairs that lead to a bottom floor with a 2nd exit below the docking point.

## Advantages

- Good Price.
- Great for chipping away at larger ships such as battlecruisers or battleships.
- It's great agility makes up for it's bulk.
- Great [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- Balanced [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) stats.
- Great Hull damage.

## Disadvantages

- Large body makes it an easy target for more inaccurate weaponry when not using it's speed to your advantage.
- Mediocre shield damage.
- Expensive compared to other options.
- Low Shield Damage.

## Strategy

- Use the **Corvid** to chip away at Capital Ships.
- Keep a distance of about 5k - 6k _above_ the enemy ship, and bombard the enemy with your 6 railgun.
- Use paired with capital ships.
- In a fleet, help your teammates finish off hulled ships.
- If you are a lower score, this ship may be a bit expensive for you, so warp away when you are hulled. Because of your balanced shield / hull ratio, your hull should be able to resist the damage while you charge your warp.

## Version History

- The **Corvid** got a buff with extra Turrets and a lower cost in an unknown version.
- 2 Light Flak Cannons got changed to 2 Light Gatling Cannons in version .62_dbg03.
- Remodeled in version .66k?
- A Light Gatling Laser replaced a Light Railgun on the side of the ship in version .75a5

## Trivia

- Once considered useless, the ship is now more viable in [PVP]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}pvp-ships) than it was before the buff.
- Used to be the cheapest Destroyer upon release.
- Held on to its alpha model longer than most ships.
- It has two entrances, one on the top which is the one used to dock, and one on the bottom. Both are on the back.
