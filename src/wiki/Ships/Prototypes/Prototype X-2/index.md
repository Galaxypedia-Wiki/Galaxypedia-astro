The **_Prototype X-2_** is a [**Prototype**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes) that was made by the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall).

## Description

The **Prototype X-2** is a [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) [Prototype]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes) class flagship, capable of the highest damage output of any obtainable ship in the game. It features good turning speed and a long bow that can be used for maneuvering in point-blank combat.

It is the second largest of all [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) ships (by physical size, in which the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator) is the only larger ship) seen in Galaxy and was formerly acquired by players for 5 million credits, an [Alien Device]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Computer), and a Weapons Part. (The **X-2** was originally priced at 2 million credits). Players had to first find the [cswimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}cswimr) to be able to buy this ship. Currently, the Prototype X-2 is only available through an exorbitant price tag in [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion). It costs 50k [Silicate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 40k [Carbon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 30k [Iridium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Adamantite]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Palladium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Titanium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Quantium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 10k [Uranium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 15k [Alien Parts]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Part), 15 [Alien Devices]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Device), 5 [Kneall Cores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Core), 1 [Charged Kneall Munitions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Charged-Kneall-Munitions), and 15 million credits.

The Prototype X-2 has a [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) "Kneall Munitions"

## Appearance

There is a detailed hallway leading to a glowing sphere (pilot's seat) and a bunch of screens, one of which is the main screen that says "Welcome USER."

The exterior has the green and purple glowing parts of the other [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) ships, and it has a large space in the middle, with a singular front prong breaking off into two. It has a large amount of thrusters and a pink-white trail.

## Advantages

- Extremely high [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) firepower gives this ship the highest average Damage per Second of any single player-ownable ship in the game.
- Rather speedy and maneuverable for a ship of its size; considerably more so than the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1).
- Most people will avoid combat with this ship, since it is able to absolutely obliterate almost any Capital Ship with ease (though it may be more difficult to destroy [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) due to the Damage per Second of a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) swarm, or other [Super Capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships)).
- Great against [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships), or other similarly sized [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- Fast firing [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), good for stealing kills.
- Very high health.
- Huge cargo hold for its class.
- Powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- If destroyed, it has a HUGE explosion size of 15,000 studs likely wiping out all who killed it.
- Smaller ships are of almost no worry since they would barely chip away the health of a Super Capital ship such as the Prototypes.
- Has an ambience that's louder than the one of Prototype X-1. Its alien-like ambience adds to Prototype X-2's menacing nature.

## Disadvantages

- Not as much health as the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1).
- Not as good at [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) as the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1), however it is still more effective than most ships due to the high health and massive Damage per Second.
- Once destroyed, it becomes unobtainable, until the next time a Prototype goes on rotation, which can take quite a while.
- Large [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) leave it vulnerable to swarms of small, fast ships like [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
- Now it's cheaper than the Prototype X-1 due to the new quest costs, but still it's very expensive.
- Requires good [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) aiming in order to be used at full power.
- A huge target due to its limited status and the fact that its destruction will most likely bounty wipe its pilot.
- Quite a loud ambience. Your teammates may ask you to despawn for it.

## Strategy

- In a siege, gather support to fend off smaller ships.
- Use the long front of this ship to propel yourself under enemy ships by wedging it under them and turning upward. This way you can be out of the line of sight of most turrets and still hit all of your weapons.
- Only use the [Subcannon and Hypercannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) when they have a proper line of sight.
- Use the extremely high firepower to destroy [capital ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) like [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) or [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) in ridiculous speed.
- Be very careful with this ship. Despite the immense power, it is extremely expensive, currently costing many millions of credits along with special quest items and parts from bosses, so you cannot afford to lose it.

- Has unique sounds for [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Old Description: The X-2 Prototype is a warship that requires level 5 security clearance to even view the files on it. Engineered with tech from the Kneall. It's extremely experimental, use at your own peril.

Since then, as of 7/31/2021 seehyadued52 and greenninja010 have done an updated battle.
