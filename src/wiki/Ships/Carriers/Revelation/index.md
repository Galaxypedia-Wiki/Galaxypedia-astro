{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Revelation_** is a heavily armed [**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Description

The **Revelation** is a massive [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), larger than most [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), and has a large interior.

## Appearance

The **Revelation** is a massive, long Carrier that has one of the largest interiors in the game.

The **Interior** is a large, carpeted area but mostly empty to reduce lag. In the middle of it you will find a sign that says "Rev Cafe" and a Menu next to the cafeteria. If you walk down the hallway, you will end up in a large, but empty room with a window out the front and a teleporter to the hangar. There are a few seats in them facing out of the windows.

The **Bridge** is fairly small and has a window in the back. There are a few seats near the pilot and a seat behind facing a glass table, taken from the old [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse). The pilot's seat has a blue orb in front of it, supposedly the steering wheel.

The **Fighter Bay** is an area in which contains 6 [Strikers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker) lined up in a row. On the back end of the hangar, you find a teleporter to the bridge.

## Advantages

- High [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower makes it well-defended against attackers.
- Can support fleets in a large scale siege.
- Able to resist attacks from [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) for a limited amount of time due to its high health.
- With some skill, the **Revelation** can PvP some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) without needing the support of its [Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker).
- Has a monstrous damage per second of **920** if all fighters are used.

## Disadvantages

- Sluggish mobility.
- Can be overwhelmed by smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) if the blind spot under the ship remains undefended.
- Very large and makes a huge target for enemy [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Lacks the maneuverability to flee from critical situations.
- Long way from the seats to the fighters due to having no teleporters in between them.

## Strategy

- Don't go into open spaces because you can be ambushed by smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Make sure your team listens to your orders. If your team is good enough, they can use [Strikers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker) to burn through a base's [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Stay behind siege ships. [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) provide excellent cover.
- Only charge when [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) charge. Otherwise, focus on guiding the [Laser Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) instead of [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
