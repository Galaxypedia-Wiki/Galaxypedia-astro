The **_Ghoul Nyx_** is a slightly redesigned [Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx) made for the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017).

## Description

The **Ghoul Nyx** is the reskinned version of the [Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx) made for the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017), and carries 10 [Spirits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spirit). It uses the original model of the Nyx with a different color scheme.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Ghoul Nyx **is the same as the original Nyx model: very empty apart from the pilot's seat and hangar.

## Advantages

- [Spirits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spirit) have high firepower.
- Monstrous total health of 30000 is only lower than the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) and [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2).
- High [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) count allows swarming of large ships.
- Extremely high mobility for a ship of its size.

## Disadvantages

- Colossal explosion size puts everyone in danger of taking heavy damage or having nearby ships and bases destroyed.
- Can easily be destroyed by multiple [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) if undefended.
- Demands cooperation in order for a proper combat scenario to be effective.
- A huge target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates).
- Was super expensive at the time, at a whopping $567,356 credits ($1,567,094.8 credits if you need to upgrade your warehouse).
- Required a level 27 [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse).
- [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) have low damage output.
- Mediocre Cargo Hold.

## Strategy

- Always travel in a fleet to ensure maximum effectiveness.
- Bait and Switch; warp into a dangerous zone, deploy the [Spirits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spirit) and then warp out of the zone leaving the Spirits to deal with whatever you wanted dealt with.
- When at war with multiple factions, they will almost always gather a fleet with the purpose of defeating it. Never rely on the Ghoul Nyx's health to tank a fleet.

## Version History

- Received some buffs in .60d that boosted Shields by 375 and Hull by 400.
- Received a few buffs in .64c that (probably) gave the **Ghoul Nyx** turrets and more health.
- Shield increased from 14000 to 15000 in version .68d.
- Top speed increased from 35 to 50 in version .70c, along with every other ship that has a top speed of lower than 50.
- Health increased from 15k/14k to 16k/14.5k, interior re-added in version .73b3

## Trivia

- This ship was the most expensive [Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) in the game, up until the release of the [Prototypes]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes), and then the [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris), and then Super Capitals.
- Can go months at a time without being spawned.
- The largest [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017) ship that was available.
- There is a decal in the cockpit that states: GET OUT #Y#O#U#W#I#L#L#P#A#Y.
- Has specialized [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), those being the Spirits.
- One of the Event Ships that was brought back for the [2019 Black Friday]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}black-friday-2019) sale.
- Highest health out of all non-[Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).
