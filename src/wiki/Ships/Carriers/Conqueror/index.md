## Description

The Conqueror is a large, [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth) Carrier that is the parallel ship to the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator). It is very expensive, with a material cost of 30k [Silicate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 22.5k [Carbon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 15k [Iridium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2.5k [Adamantite]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2.5k [Palladium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2.5k [Titanium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2.5k [Quantium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) 13,583 Uranium, 1 [Conqueror Reactor Core]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Conqueror-Reactor-Core), and 2,000,000 Credits, totaling around 3,500,000 credits worth of materials. It has 10 fighters, 2 being battlecruiser equivalents and 8 being light fighters, with great combined DPS. While the Annihilator has more DPS on the ship, the Conqueror is more geared towards health and uses its diverse selection of fighters for damage.

## Appearance

The Conqueror is a very large ship, rivaling most Supercapitals in size. It has similar decoration styles to other [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth) ships, such as the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement) and [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator). Its figher bays are located on the sides, with three on each. Each bay holds either one [Chimera-N]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera-N) or two [U.N.E. Interceptors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E.-Interceptor). It has a few very large engines in the back, and a few more on the bottom. ![Size comparison of

## Advantages

- Strong, high-damage fighters.
- Very tanky, with a total of 65,000 health.
- [Chimera-N]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera-N) fighters have good health and take some work to kill.
- Good range on turrets.

## Disadvantages

- Awful LoS, the underside and back are huge blindspots.
- 10 fighters, making it expensive to fully equip with AI.
- Very slow.
- Huge and easy to hit with spinals.
- Not a lot of turret DPS.

## Strategy

- This ship is a shield tank; Do NOT use it against large shield-damaging fleets.
- The low mass of the Conqueror makes it extremely easy to push around. Watch out for anything with a lot of mass going directly towards you.
- Use your fighters to your advantage; Stay 7-8k distance away from enemies and snipe them, while your fighters do the bulk of the damage.
- Watch out for anything going under you, as that is a huge blindspot.
- Do NOT use this ship alone, as it will get dived due to its value. Always fly in fleets of players you trust.

## Version History

- Added on 2024/04/12, but not logged in an actual version. The most recent version after its implementation is .77d22.

## Trivia

- Was Announced with a message from GodRevyD that simply stated: "Added UNE carrier thing".
- The [U.N.E.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth) counterpart to the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator).
- The first (and currently only) carrier to be built by the UNE.
- Within the first few hours of being released, around 10 people had already bought one.
- Most of the ship is non-collidable, so other ships and players can simply pass through it.
- It has an incredibly low mass, which allows it to be knocked around by fast, heavy ships such as the [SR-71]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}SR-71).
- One of the few ships to have turrets angled when in resting position.
- The first person to lose this ship was dandcx to BobTheSmuggler's Retro Sixfold.
