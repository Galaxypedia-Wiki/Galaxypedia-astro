{{< notices/advancedShip >}}

The **_Borealis_** is an extremely powerful [Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Description

The **Borealis** is a large [Advanced]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) which carries 12 [Blitzes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz).

This ship has enormous firepower from its Fighters, making it useful for Sieges and Fleet battles.

## Appearance

The **Borealis** has a rather industrial look and has a mostly greyscale colour scheme with splashes of orange here and there. The ship has a very long profile and its dorsal side is littered with various grey, white and orange armour plates, along with many turrets. There are 6 fighter bays on the **Borealis,** which fits 2 [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz), and each bay opens up to both the port and starboard surfaces of the ship. On its ventral side, towards the front of the ship, is a large vertical fin-like protrusion which hosts one turret on both its port and starboard sides each, a feature similar to a hydrofoil-like fin underneath its counterpart. The interior of the **Borealis** is taken up almost entirely by the fighter bay. What few decorations exist are limited to the pilot seat room, which has a large Yellow orb and a throne-like pilot's seat with a simple control board.

## Advantages

- Armed with a decent arsenal of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Extremely High DPS for a carrier with fighters, standing at a monstrous 1050 DPS combined, rivaling that of [Retro Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Nyx).
- Large and balanced health pool, at 27500 shield and hull.
- Has more consistent Fighter firepower than other carriers of because the [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz)'s high turret firepower.
- Decent turret DPS gives it some ability to support itself even without its fighters.

## Disadvantages

- Extremely slow.
- Large and easy to hit, especially from underneath or behind it.
- Large blindspots under and behind the ship.
- Extremely expensive due to it being an [Advanced Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) and a Carrier, especially due to requiring a [Weapons Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Weapons-Part).

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.
- Target AA ships like the [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron) or [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) so your fighters don't die.
- Never go alone if you do not have fighters.
- It can be used as a support [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in sieges by carrying [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to distract enemy [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), as well as providing great support from its large fighter swarm.
- Watch out for fleets of [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that have the aim of defeating you.
- Try not to engage when you don't have fighters. This ship is gains most of its power from their added damage.
- Go to the bottom of the map, right at the border and release the fighters from below your enemy. Do this because majority of your turrets are on top of the ship so you can fire on anyone who attempts to attack you.
- Warp in, release all your fighters and then warp out as soon as you can to your nearest or strongest Starbase if you don't want to risk your ship.

## Version History

- One of the ships to receive an event remodel during the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018). The remodel is known as the [Skeletal Ghostealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Skeletal-Ghostealis).
- Shields reduced from 12000 to 9000, 4 [Light Gatling Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replaced with 2 [Heavy Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 7 [Quantum Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz) spawns reduced from 16 to 6, re-classified as an [Advanced Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) and received a remodel in version .69e
- Got stripped of its [Advanced Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) class, and put back on the build menu, shields increased from 9000 to 12000 and 7 [Quantum Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) changed to 7 [Heavy Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .69f, which caused a very massive price increase.
- Received a total turret loadout overhaul, lost 1200mÂ³ of Cargo Hold Space and price was massively reduced so it is somewhat feasible to get in version .72d.
- 3 Medium Cannons replaced with 3 Quad Advanced Cannons in version .72d.
