The **_Icarus_** is a large, combat-based, defensive [**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers). 

## Description

The **Icarus** is a large-sized carrier with very good combat capabilities. With its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 3 [Valkyries]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Valkyrie), the **Icarus** is a powerful combat-based [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers). Unlike most Carriers, it has very good Turret firepower and can fight against a variety of ships, ranging from small [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) to large [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships). It may even destroy [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) without much trouble, though this requires [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) support and skill.

## Appearance

The ship is entered through the [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) bay, which leads to a teleporter that sends you to the bridge. From there you walk forward to enter the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Powerful on its own, without the need of any [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Good Health.
- Has powerful [Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Valkyrie), which have high [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) firepower.
- Equipping all fighters with AI pilots is relatively cheap, costing only 750 robux to fill them all with VIP.
- Useful for quickly taking down Capital ships with the high DPS of the ship and fighters combined.
- Can easily destroy AI enemies by distracting them with fighters and using turrets for the rest.

## Disadvantages

- Low maneuverability.
- Only has 3 Fighters.
- Expensive.
- Medium-sized blind spot at the rear of the ship.
- Small ships can enter the fighter bay.
- Large blindspot underneath the ship

## Strategy

- Don't go into battle alone as multiple strong ships can overwhelm it. Make sure to have an escort and pick fights carefully.
- Know how to pilot this kind of ship and bring [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) pilots before entering combat.
- Make sure to approach from below so your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) can be used.
- With having [Valkyrie]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Valkyrie) fighters, it is beneficial to take advantage of them as they have great DPS and speed.

## Trivia

- The previous model was most likely based on the Republic Venator attack cruiser from Star Wars.
- This ship is often considered a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)-[Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) hybrid because it has more firepower than most [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) do, but also carries some [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
