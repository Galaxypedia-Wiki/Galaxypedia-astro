{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **Stormbringer** was the first [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) to be added, introduced in version .40, and has received 3 remodels.

## Description

The **Stormbringer** is a pretty well-balanced ship in terms of weaponry. While the turret armament is focused on lasers, the ship also possesses 2 medium cannons for dealing damage to a ship's hull once an its shield has been shredded by the vast laser array. The **Stormbringer** can be considered the shield-breaking counterpart of the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis), another carrier. Relationships like these have been seen before, like the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight) and [Warden]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warden), for instance.

It carries 6 **[Typhoons.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Typhoon)**

## Appearance

The **Stormbringer's** bridge is exceedingly basic, being a plain grey cuboid-shaped room with a single wool-textured pad on the floor that acts as the pilot seat. Don't worry, the ship building hangar is working on building the interior right now. The fighter bay is a small, cramped little dark grey compartment that opens out of dorsal side of the ship near the stern, housing the fighters. There are neon white accents on the floor underneath each fighter, perhaps outlining landing pads. Overall, the fighter bay is vaguely resemblant of that of a real aircraft carrier, except it is dug into the ship and blanketed over the top by a transparent shield-like surface. The ship itself is very long. Most of its surfaces are littered with armour plating in various shades of grey and streaks of neon orange, except from the ventral side, which is host to a number of vertical protrusions. The most notable of these protrusions looks rather like a hydrofoil's foil. It is also reminiscent of the massive vertical protrusion on the Borealis' underbelly.

## Advantages

- Has a decent amount of fighters.
- Great [shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) DPS.
- Great [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) health.
- Devastating [Nuke]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nuking).

## Disadvantages

- Not the best maneuverability, but average among carriers.
- Lacklustre hull DPS. Even the fighters' cannons pale in comparison to their phasers.
- Can't face off against bigger [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) without the help of the [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Fighter bay is completely open, allowing for small ships such as fighters, frigates, destroyers, cruisers and even smaller battlecruisers to sneak inside and deal damage from within.
- While not completely a blind spot, there is a significant lack of firepower on the ventral area of the ship near the stern. The lower bow, however, is completely unguarded.
- No longer the cheapest ship, now it's the fifth most expensive, giving a big risk.

## Strategy

- Be sure to target ships like the Ampharos, as they can shred your fighters very efficiently, especially considering the Wrath's small health pool.
- Be very wary of hull-breakers such as the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker) or [other ships similar to it]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}hull-breakers). This ship's health pool relies primarily on its hull health.

<!-- -->

- You can attempt to fighter [swarm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fighter-Swarming), as the fighters are provided in sufficient amounts to effectively assault a target.
- DON'T let ships warp underneath you. It will likely spell huge damage or even destruction to your ship.
- Some players use this ship as a nuke... as it has a massive nuke and can one-shot anything under a battleship, and some dreadnoughts.

## Trivia

- The old **Stormbringer** had what seemed to be a large runway on the top. Although it may have been meant to be used for landing, it was rarely used by players other than as a walking platform.
- The **Stormbringer's **original model was nicknamed "The Shoebox"
- The third model and [its fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wrath) were only used briefly until they were removed in favour of the current model, likely due to issues like not enough fighters and a lack of a fighter bay teleporter.
