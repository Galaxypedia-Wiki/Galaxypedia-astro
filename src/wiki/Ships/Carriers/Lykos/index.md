The **_Lykos_** is a **[Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)** which was going to be awarded to the first-place winner of the [Galaxy Tournament](https://challonge.com/GalaxyAT).

## Description

The **Lykos** is a sleek, long PvP-Carrier with powerful turrets and spinals. It stands out among [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) with its high health and single fighter, making it comparable to [Super Capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) in terms of firepower. This ship was originally going to be awarded to the first-place winner of the Galaxy Tournament, however after being inactive for the longest time, it was announced that the Tournament was no longer continuing. The **Lykos **and [C Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}C-Class) will never be distributed or even added to the game.

## Interior

The **Lykos** is intended to be a yacht, and as such features the most luxurious interior in galaxy: 2 bedrooms, a lounge, a command deck and a large control room.

## Advantages

- Health comparable to a [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).
- High top speed for its class.
- Ludicrously powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Huge cargo hold.
- High DPS.
- All [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fire at the same time.

## Disadvantages

- Will be targeted in almost every battle due to being the rarest ship in the game.
- Don't be fooled by the massive health pool; a fleet can easily wipe it out.

## Strategy

- Don't use this for trading during war.
- Travel with a large fleet at all times, and if in doubt do not use this ship.

## Version History

- Removed in version .69a2, due to the cancellation of the tournament.

## Trivia

- Only two people were going to own this ship; the 1st-place winner of the Galaxy Tournament, and the ship's creator, Bomb_pops.
- In etymology, the ship's name '**Lykos**' comes from the Greek word '_lykos_', meaning wolf.
- Due to the cancellation of the Galaxy Tournament, the **Lykos **and [C Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}C-Class) will never be added to the game, let alone be distributed.
