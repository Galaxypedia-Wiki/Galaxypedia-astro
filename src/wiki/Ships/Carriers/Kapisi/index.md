{{< notices/premiumShip >}}

The **_Kapisi_** was an exclusive [**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) for those who contributed to or purchased from the Galaxy Store during the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018). It is now available in the Robux shop menu for 6,500 Robux.

## Description

The **Kapisi** is a mid-sized [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), and a reskin of the [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala). It has a large bridge section and two fighter bays connected by transparent pathways. Each bay feeds into a central launching area that leads to the outside of the ship. The [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) contains 12 [Bonehawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bonehawk) [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Appearance

Like it's original counterpart, the [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala), the interior of the **Kapisi** consists of a teleporter that leads straight to the ships bridge (Which is inside the hanger of the ship). If you choose not to walk onto the teleporter, you would find yourself walking down a long pathway where you can see the [Bonehawks]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bonehawk). The left side of the carrier is exactly the same as the right site, excluding the ramp to exit or enter the ship. Inside each hanger (which consist of 2 [Bonehawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bonehawk) Fighters), there is an array of seats so that people planning to pilot the [Bonehawks]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bonehawk) may have a spot to sit while the carrier warps.

## Advantages

- No blind spots.
- Quite fast and maneuverable for its size and class.
- Very powerful [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) that do balanced damage.
- Many powerful [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Large cargo hold.
- High health compared to most build menu carriers.
- Fighters' DPS totals to a ridiculous 1047, the most fighter DPS of **any** carrier in the game.

## Disadvantages

- Significant target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates).
- Lacks [Small Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Bad [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement.
- Extremely rare, alongside the [Blizzard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blizzard) and the [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala).
- Limited event ship, putting a giant target on it.
- Costs a TON to equip all it's fighters with AI pilots costing 3000 robux without VIP, only being beaten by the Nimitz.

## Strategy

- Be sure to have teammates to make use of the [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- When in doubt, don't use it. It is an extremely prized target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) and bounty hunters.
- Stay at the back of the fleet and take down any large ships that come near you.
- While the **Kapisi** has a combined health of 43,000 it wouldn't be recommended to tank anything due to the amount of players that would target a hulled, limited [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Version History

- Made unobtainable after the [Halloween 2018 Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018) ended.
- Health increased from 7000/7000 to 9000/9000 in version .68d.
- Remodeled by EvilPleeber119 in version .75a5.

## Trivia

![Bonehawk Fighter]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bonehawk.png-"Bonehawk-Fighter"){width="220" height="220"}

- Much of the roof in the back of this ship has no collision, allowing you to jump in and out of the ship through the ceiling.

- The **_Kapisi_** is a reference to the command carrier Kapisi from Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak.
