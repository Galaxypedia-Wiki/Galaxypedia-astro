{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Vanguard_** is a mid-size and speedy [**Battleship**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)/[**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)**-[Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)** hybrid.

## Description

The **Vanguard** is a very compact [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) and the smallest in the game. It has low [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) firepower and is commonly used as a support [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers). The outside appears very armored, but it has rather low health for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)-class ship.

This [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) containsÂ 2 [Falcons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Falcon).

## Interior

When you enter the ship through the right hangar, there will be a command room to the right. Inside the command room, there is a pilot seat and some control panels.

## Advantages

- Smaller than some other [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), about the size of the average [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts); if not a little smaller, but has the benefit of being the fastest and most agile Carrier in the game, even being faster than most [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and can be very annoying to chase and/or maintain constant positional advantage for larger ships.
- Versatile [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Durable [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Low fighter count, making it cheap to equip with full [AI Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI-Fighters).

## Disadvantages

- Only has 2 Falcons.
- If carriers with a better fighter fleet are available, use of this ship is impractical as there is only one Carrier allowed per team.
- Large blind-spot below the ship.
- Spinals can be hard to aim due to the large gap between the position of the two spinals.
- Lowest health of all Carriers, but still significantly better than several of the available Dreadnoughts.
- While cheap, it has a very high warehouse level requirement to build.

## Strategy

- A very powerful ship for killing [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) or [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) with since you can deploy the Y.Falcons to distract the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and destroy other [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) while the base is distracted.
- Do not use the **Vanguard** in a siege unless no one else has a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), as only one is allowed per faction.
- Use the Falcons the way you would use a [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) while [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) since they are tanky but have a weak armament.

## Trivia

- The smallest [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in Galaxy (disputed, the ship has undergone a remodel and now has a similar size factor to the [Stormbringer's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stormbringer) current model).
-
- The only [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in the game that spawns [Falcons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Falcon).
- The [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala) uses the same description as the **Vanguard**.
- <s>The model is currently broken, so that the fighters spawn too high and are hard to enter.</s> The model was fixed in a recent update when the Vanguard was re-released into the game.
- Many people are upset about the recent overhaul, preferring the old version due to the speed, small size, and amazing DPS along with good health and damage resistance. Now the **Vanguard** is considered a mediocre carrier due to the high cost, low health, and underwhelming power.
