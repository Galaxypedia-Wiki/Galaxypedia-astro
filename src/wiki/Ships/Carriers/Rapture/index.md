{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Rapture_** is a [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging)-focused [**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)with Medium and Heavy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). _Not to be confused with the [Raptor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Raptor)_

## Description

The **Rapture** is a strangely-shaped [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) with many odd, mystical-looking decorations placed around the ship. It features four arced structures that come to a point past the back of the ship and a thinner nose area that connects to Starbase docking points.

The **Rapture** carries 3 [Strikers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker) and 3 [Inflictors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Inflictor).

## Appearance

The entrance is a teleporter shaped like an elongated sphere located in a small tunnel in the nose. This takes players to the fighter bay. On the roof of the hangar, it says "Release the Seventh Seal".

At the end of the hangar is a larger teleporter that leads to bridge.

The **Rapture** has a nice fighter bay with fancy pillars and decorations.

The bridge contains a big screen in front of the pilot's seat and a clear floor with a reactor core under the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- High health and [Heavy Siege Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) give it the ability to tank fire and attack during [Sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging), especially against hulled bases.
- Somewhat cheap for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- Essentially a siege [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) with fighters.
- [Heavy Siege Railguns, and Super LR Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) give it decent long-range firepower.
- Highest alpha damage for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) thanks to the heavy-hitting, long-range turrets.

## Disadvantages

- Somewhat vulnerable bottom.
- Huge blind spots, requiring accurate aiming for all [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to have a line of sight.
- [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage are not balanced, as it mostly relies on its [Frenzies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frenzy) to do shield damage.
- It is large and slow, making it an easy target to hit.
- Has a hard time defeating smaller [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) without its [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Strategy

- Do not engage an enemy base without the help of your [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) pilots or allied [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- Work with your [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) and tank while your [Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fighter-Swarming) dish out shield damage.
- Tell your teammates to fly the [Frenzies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frenzy) in groups so they will be more effective, as there are only six(Or, spend Robux on obtaining 6 [AI Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI-Fighters)).
- Never go alone without your faction using your [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters). Without support, you could be ambushed with ease.
- Use the ship to tank for your fleet [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or Planets in [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) situations.
- Watch out for experienced fleets that want to destroy you.
- If you are far enough away, you can snipe people at ungodly ranges.
- Use this ship's high alpha damage to decimate smaller [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) or [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships), since those have low resistance to damage.

## Version history

- Health increased from 6000/6750 to 6500/9000, 2 [Heavy Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replaced with 2 [Heavy Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .68d.
