{{< notices/limitedShip >}}

The **_Alpha Ship_**is a [**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) only available to [Alpha Players]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Badges).

## Description

The **Alpha Ship** is a Carrier easily recognizable because of its large size and color scheme.

It carries 6 completely unique [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), all miniature versions of Alpha/early Beta models.

Each fighter is as follows: [Mini Alpha Warlock]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mini-Alpha-Warlock), [Mini Beta Behemoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mini-Beta-Behemoth), [Mini Alpha Naglfar]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mini-Alpha-Naglfar), [Mini Alpha Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mini-Alpha-Leviathan), [Mini Beta Andromeda]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mini-Beta-Andromeda), and [Mini Alpha Cyclops]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mini-Alpha-Cyclops).

The **Alpha Ship** can only be acquired by playing in alpha, which ended in 2016. To claim the ship, make an admin ticket in the official discord support server.

## Interior

The **Alpha Ship**'s Interior consists of a detailed bridge with a pilot's seat, screens and two teleporters. Sitting in the pilot's chair the teleporter on the right sends you to a box with 2 red bunk beds and a screen with a 3D view of the alpha ship. The teleporter on the left sends you to the hanger, before you reach the fighters there is a 3D hologram showing the Alpha ship fighting an Alien fleet.

## Advantage

- High health.
- Free for Alpha badge owners.
- Only carries 6 Fighters, making full utilization easier.
- Powerful Fighters that can deal insane damage if all are used.

## Disadvantages

- Must be at a closer range to deal effective [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- The **Alpha Ship** is a large target making it an easy target for [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Only players that have the Alpha Badge or other proof can get it; requires asking an admin.
- Heavy Lasers are ineffective against small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), especially at long-range.
- Vulnerable underside.
- Low maneuverability.
- Rather underwhelming firepower in general, the ship struggles to even destroy a large [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) without the support of its fighters.

## Strategy

- Be careful and know what [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) you can safely take on based on the situation.
- Warp in, deploy your Fighters, and warp out.
- Siege bases using your Fighters.

## Version History

- Health increased from 8000/8000 to 10000/9000 in version .68d.
- Received a buff in version .71b, increasing its Hull from 9000 to 9001.
