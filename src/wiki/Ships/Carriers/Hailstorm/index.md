## Description

The **Hailstorm** is a winter-themed [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) from the first stage of the [2019 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2019). It houses 4 unique [Frostfires,]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frostfire) which are powerful [Fighters.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)

## Appearance

The interior is a small black box with several chairs, one being the pilot chair. There are also several icicles hanging down from the ceiling.

## Advantages

- Powerful high accuracy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) allow it to fight ships of all sizes.
- High health allows it to take a beating from enemy ships.
- Has 4 [Frostfires]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frostfire) for [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) that rival the [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen), making them powerful for [Fighters.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)
- Has very high firepower for a carrier, allowing it to destroy other large [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) without the assistance of its fighters.
- Relatively cheap to equip all it's fighters with AI pilots, only costing 1000 robux without VIP.

## Disadvantages

- Expensive for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), at a whopping $1,073,519 credits ($3,003,500 credits if you upgrade the warehouse from level 1 to level 33)
- Is a [Limited Ship,]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) so it will make you a larger target.
- Required a level 29 [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse) to build when it was onsale.

## Version History

- Health increased from 7500/7500 to 11000/8500 and [Medium Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) changed to [Heavy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) variants in version .68d.
- Health decreased back to 7500/7500 in version ???

## Trivia

- Most expensive ship in the first stage of the [Christmas Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2019), and it is also the second most expensive of all [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), The first one being the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator).
- The first player to lose this ship was CVN83, after he lost connection next to a Level 4 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase). He escaped the base with just 31 [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) only to be killed moments later by DJFancehFeast's [Zhen]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zhen).
- The most sought after ship of the event.
- The design of the **Hailstorm** can be seen as an unintentional hybrid of multiple ships. The exterior looks to be a fusion between the remodeled [Cyclops]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyclops) and [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest) Dreadnoughts. The **Hailstorm** also operates like the [Icarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Icarus) carrier bringing 4 unique fighters, the [Frostfires]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frostfire) are armed with 2 small torpedoes, 6 small phaser spinals, 2 light gatling cannons and lasers. It also has a nearly identical interior to the [Hasatan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hasatan) battleship, with the only difference being ice and snow building up in the corners.
- It's also ViklyMF's favorite ship.
