_This page is about the player-ownable vessel. If you're looking for the NPC variant, see [Devastator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastator)._

The **_Annihilator_** is a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) made by the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) for the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event).

## Description

The **Annihilator** is a long [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) that is based off the [Devastator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastator), but is significantly smaller and has nerfed stats than the ship it is derived from. It carries 4 [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) themed [A - Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}A---Bruiser) fighters and 1 Unique battleship fighter, the [A - Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}A---Brawler). It can be acquired by speaking to [cswimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}cswimr) at Frion that requires 2,000,000 credits 30k [Silicate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 22.5k [Carbon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 15k [Iridium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2.5k [Adamantite]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2.5k [Palladium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2.5k [Titanium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 2.5k [Quantium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), 5k [Alien Parts]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Part), 10 [Alien Devices]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Device), 2 [Kneall Cores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Core), and 1 [Annihilator Fighter Bay]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator-Fighter-Bay).

## Appearance

The Annihilator is a long, slender carrier that has an almost identical appearance to the Devastator. It is one of the largest alien ships in the game, rivalling the size of the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2). There are 2 teleporters, one leading to the interior and bridge of the ship, one leads to the fighter bay.

The <u>**Fighter Bay**</u> is a long hangar housing 4 [A - Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}A---Bruiser) fighters, and at the end of the bay lies the teleporter to the [A - Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}A---Brawler), which lies under the ship.

The <u>**Interior**</u> is identical to the interior of the [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator), description of the interior is identical to that of the mentioned ship. With the exception of the 2 holograms on the left side. The "Avoid at all cost pizza" has been replaced with "Diagnosis: Skill Issue" and the kneall mech has been replaced with the face of an ape.

## Advantages

- Has a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) comparable to a battleship.
- Great for supporting siege fleets with its high health, great fighters, and massive dps.
- Terrifying power rivaling Super Capitals, for far less cost at the time of the event.
- High [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- The fighters possess incredible combined firepower if used in a swarm, and even more so if the carrier itself is supporting it.
- Has more firepower by itself than most non limited [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- High total health of 27,500 Hull and 32,500 Shields, comparable to a weak [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).
- Massive total damage output when combined with [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Very powerful unique fighters.
- It has an explosion radius of , rivaling that of [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) nukes and can **destroy full shield [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)**.

## Disadvantages

- Rather low [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage compared to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- Sluggish turn speed.
- Very expensive to get additionally with the 5% chance of getting an Annihilator Fighter Bay, making it a massive target
- Struggles to fire all turrets at once, unless pointing directly at its target. (Even then, some turrets can still be blocked)
- Similar to other obtainable [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) [capital ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), the turrets have rather poor accuracy.
- Its extremely powerful nuke will be a threat to your own fleet/team when your ship is destroyed.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.
- **NEVER** use this ship for tanking damage. The expense of it alone makes it a massive target.
- It can be used as a support [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in sieges by carrying [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to distract enemy [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), as well as providing great support from its Battleship-like fighter.
- Useful in fleets, as it provides a powerful and disposable Fighter.
- Get a player pilot in the [A - Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}A---Brawler) rather than using an [AI Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI-Fighters) slot for it as a player could make use of the fighter's full potential.
- When fighting with the Annihilator, try and stay pointed to your opponent so all your turrets have a line of sight.
- Be aggressive when you must engage in combat. Due to the low range nature of Annihilator's turrets, not being able to fire the first shot will put you in a disadvantage.
- Try not to engage when you don't have fighters. This ship is only extremely powerful when paired with its fighters.
- If you think your ship will be destroyed, Warp your ship away as **far as possible** from your own fleet or starbase as the nuke has a whopping radius of , and if possible, you can warp to the enemy's fleet or starbase to bring the nuke there instead.

- One of the few playable ships of 100% Kneall design in-game, the others being the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), the [Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Brawler), the [Onslaught]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Onslaught) and the [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator).
- One of the only 2 [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) to house a Battleship like fighter: The [A - Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}A---Brawler), while the other carrier being [Hevnetier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hevnetier) and it's fighter, the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis).
- One of the highest DPS carriers in the game, tied with the [Hailstorm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hailstorm) and [Sakala]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sakala). _(without fighters)_
- Used to be one of the only ships with an ambience. In fact, it is the only Carrier that used to have one, and had the loudest and longest range ambience out of every other ship.
- Used to have the second most expensive material cost in the game, requiring a blueprint from the quest [Reverse Engineering]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Reverse-Engineering) and materials totaling at 1.9 Million, only behind [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer) and the [Prototypes]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes).
- The first person to lose an **Annihilator** was skinnidafam to an Alien [Devastator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastator).
- There used to be a flagship plan for Annihilator, which sought to make Annihilator's health 14000/10000 and give it even more powerful turrets, fully pushing it into the Super Capital range. However, it was eventually cancelled and the Annihilator received a permanent health nerf.
- At some point, the Annihilator had a bug where it was completely invincible due to hitboxes being bugged, the ship was put off sale and was unspawnable, it was then fixed a couple of days later. All though, during the bug when players discovered it, they used it to their advantage to solo out bases in galaxy and win every time, making this bug pretty game breaking.
