The **_Sakala_**is an exclusive[ ]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:carrier)[Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) available for 5000 robux, or can be won during a giveaway.

## Description

The **Sakala** is a large, powerful [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) available for 5000 robux. It contains 6 [Firehawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Firehawk) [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Appearance

The interior of theÂ **Sakala** is a small metal box with a pilot's seat and 7 teleporters, 6 of them leading to fighter bays and one leading to the outside of the ship. The fighter bays are completely undecorated boxes each holding one [Firehawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Firehawk).

## Advantages

- Very high speed for its class, outpacing most [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Highly maneuverable for its class and size.
- Large health pool.
- Very powerful [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) that do balanced damage.
- Strong [fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Disadvantages

- A huge target for [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Mediocre [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) placement.
- Can only be obtained for the the very high price of 5,000 Robux from in in-game menu.

## Strategy

- Be certain to have teammates willing to pilot the [fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) or obtain the 6 needed [AI fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI-Fighters) (1,500 robux).
- Beware of swarms of smaller ships: your low [turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) accuracy and limited line of sight will fare poorly against small targets.
- Make use of the powerful [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets) against large targets to deal optimal damage.
- Don't overestimate your health pool, two [build-menu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) [dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) could wipe it in under a minute.
- Use sparingly. This is a huge target for [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Avoid [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) ships.
- Don't use this as your everyday [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers). It is a limited ship. Treat it as such to avoid losing it.
