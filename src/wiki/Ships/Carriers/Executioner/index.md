{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Executioner_** is a Dreadnought-like **[Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)** equipped with two resilient and powerful fighters.

## Description

The **Executioner** is a [Carrier]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) that houses two [Hunters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hunter), which are powerful Battlecruiser-like fighters. Unlike most carriers, the **Executioner **does not rely fully on its fighters for damage output, as it is equipped with powerful [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) weaponry, as well as having a good healthpool to tank damage.

## Appearance

The interior of the **Executioner** is a room with 3 teleporters: one to get in or out and 2 for the fighters. The pilot seat is in the middle, & 3 screens line the walls.

## Advantages

- High overall damage output; its average DPS is comparable to that of many [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).

<!-- -->

- Relatively cheap to fully outfit with AI Fighters, as it only has 2 fighters.
- Great speed and mobility for its class; its maneuverability rivals that of the [Leviathan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan)'s.
- Its [Hunters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hunter) are very strong; they can be compared to [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) firepower-wise and have the 2nd highest health in their class, right behind the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis).
- The fighters can still be used even when recalled, due to them being directly attached to the ship's structure.

## Disadvantages

- Lacks significant long range weaponry.

<!-- -->

- Requires good Spinal aiming skills in order to use this ship to its full potential.
- Because of their positioning, the fighters are also directly exposed to enemy fire and can be easily destroyed when unreleased.
- Pretty expensive compared to other options.

## Strategy

- Warp to a base, release [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) and warp out. For max damage, let the hunters tank first and deal damage with your turrets.
- Use the [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) as a distraction for the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) or even enemy [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) as they might overreact seeing your Battlecruiser-sized [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Release [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), both fighters get used, recall them, they can still attack even if recalled.

## Version History

- Health increased from 6250/5250 to 8000/6000 in version .68d.

## Trivia

- The [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova) remodel was based on **Executioner's** fighter design.
- One of the only carriers to have Battlecruisers as [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- One of the few [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) to have an interior with an animated screen.
- Made by the Galaxy Faction [Chaotic Unity]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chaotic-Unity).
- Resembles a stripped down Harvest King.
