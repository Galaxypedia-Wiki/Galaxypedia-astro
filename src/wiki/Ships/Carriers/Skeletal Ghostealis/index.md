The **_Skeletal Ghostealis_** is an event reskin of the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) that was released when the [Halloween Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018) update came out.

## Description

The **Skeletal Ghostealis**is a reskin of the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) that carries unique long range [Wraith]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wraith) [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), which are reskins of the [Blitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blitz).

This [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) excels at [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) and Siege support as it's fighters have long range torpedoes and the Carrier itself has enough turret firepower to act as a support.

## Appearance

The **Skeletal Ghostealis** is a long and tall carrier. Unlike the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis). this variant is translucent and has an orange and brown color palette. There are also skull ornaments decorating it's Skeletal Cannon and Laser turrets.

The **<u>Interior</u>** of the **Skeletal Ghostealis**is taken up entirely by the fighter bay. There are hallways connecting on each fighter hangar and the bridge is simply a pilot seat located in one end of the fighter bay, adjacent to a teleporter leading outside.

## Advantages

- Large health pool.
- Large amount of Long range, powerful [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Good Cargo Hold.
- Has very high [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- Good for sieges, as the fighters have long range torpedoes _(9k Studs)_ and balanced damage.

## Disadvantages

- Poor mobility.
- Requires a high [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse) level and has a very expensive material cost.
- Unlike it's [Regular counterpart]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis), it costs more than the [Nyx's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx) [Halloween Counterpart]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx).
- Unable to fire all it's turrets at once, at any direction the ship points.
- Extremely large and easy to hit, especially from above or beside it.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.
- Use it's fighters for outranging Large [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) and [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) [Starbases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases)/[Planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) and as the torpedoes are long range.
- If you have to fight, stay below the enemy so majority of your turrets can fire, and take down [AA]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) Ships with your turret firepower like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) and [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron) which can shred your [Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wraith).
- **Never** use as your main ship. This is a high kill for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- **NEVER**use this ship for tanking damage. The rarity of it alone makes it a massive target.

## Version History

- Added in .65a.
- 4 [Light Gatling Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Dual Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) replaced with 2 [Heavy Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), 2 [Heavy Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), 4 [Skeletal Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Skeletal Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), [Wraith]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wraith) spawns reduced from 16 to 6 and received a remodel in version .69e.
- Removed 2 [Heavy Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), 2 [Heavy Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and replaced with 2 [Advanced Medium AutoLasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Quantum Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in an unknown version.
