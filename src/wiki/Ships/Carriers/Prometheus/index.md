{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Prometheus_** is a Super-[**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), known for its devastating [Nuke]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nuking) and 4 powerful [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Description 

The **Prometheus**is a massive [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) that carries 4 [Harbingers,]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger) which are [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers)-sized [Fighters.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) The ship features two large prongs pointing out of the front. It is the most expensive ship that a player can buy, apart from the [Super Capitals,]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) [Prototypes]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes), some [Limited Event Ships,]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) and some of the [Advanced Ships.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships)

## Interior 

The **Prometheus** has a small but detailed interior. There is a set of three teleporters. There is also a pilot seat with control panels, one saying, "all systems are online."

## Advantages 

- Very powerful [Fighters.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)
- Great [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) firepower with the fighters.
- Reasonable [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) firepower for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- Has its own unique [Fighters,]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) the [Harbinger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger), which is probably one of the best [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) of any [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), with their only disadvantage being a lack of sustainability as there are only 4.
- Massive explosion radius of 800, the highest in the game aside from most limited/advanced dreadnoughts, [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz), [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership) (level 3+), Super Capitals, both Prototypes and [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak).
- Impressive maneuverability for the enormous size, being higher than most [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- Strong health pool, has the most HP of any build menu carrier.

## Disadvantages 

- Large and has many blind spots, making it a high-profile target.
- Relatively Mediocre [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) firepower without the fighters.
- Its massive size and high part count may cause lag to the user and the user's teammates.
- Somewhat difficult for the [Harbingers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger) to leave the hangar, especially if the pilots are inexperienced or more than one fighter is trying to launch at once.
- It costs $613,500 credits to upgrade the [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse) from level 1 to level 21, which is around $240,000 credits more than a [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy).
- While strong on paper, the combination of turrets, fighters and stats makes for a fairly weak carrier capable of being destroyed by just one or two skilled [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) even with the help of all four [Harbingers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger).

## Strategy 

- In a [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) situation, use your massive health pool to tank but be sure to know when to bail (Ideally leave at 1,000 shields).
- Typically, release your [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) AFTER you engage a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or a target [Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships). The blind spot can counter the Prometheus turret firepower, so instead you must rely on your massive health pool to keep you alive while you draw the attention of enemies, while your [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) deal heavy damage.
- Use your 800 explosion radius nuke as a last resort if you know you are going to die.

## Trivia 

- Enormous physical size for a ship, having arguably the largest overall physical size of all ships in the game.
- Its fighters, 4 [Harbingers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harbinger), bear a strong resemblance to the [Marauder]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Marauder).    
- It was given a trail shortly after release.
- Ended the [Nyx's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx) two-year reign as the most expensive non-event [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- Its [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) concept is similar to the [Executioner's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner) own [Fighters.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)
- The **Prometheus** was the most expensive non-event build menu ship in the game, before Super Capital ships were released on the build menu. The ship costed 709,023 credits worth of materials and building fee to make. Counting the cost of the [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse) upgrades needed to make the ship, the total cost was 2,487,273 credits, which was 24% more than a [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) ship while they were quest ships.
- While the **Prometheus** possesses a bridge protruding from the hull near the rear of the ship and offset to the right, the actual bridge is inside the main body between the quad thruster sections and behind the hangar bay.
- The **Prometheus** possesses a teleporter in the bridge that will take the player to the exterior of the ship between the two rear dorsal thrusters. This teleporter seemingly has no use at the moment and may have been left over from when the ship was being designed and hints that the ship originally docked from the rear, or was left over from a proposed [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), similar to the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis).
- The **Prometheus** is based off the Javelin class destroyer from Star Citizen.
- The **Prometheus** was the only ship buildable with ores to exceed the storage of a level 32 [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse), at the time it exceeded that number, the maximum warehouse level was 32 but has since been raised to 35 (and then 38).
- The **Prometheus** was considered by some to be Galaxy's first supercarrier or supercapital carrier.
- This ship is a rather common sight nowadays.
