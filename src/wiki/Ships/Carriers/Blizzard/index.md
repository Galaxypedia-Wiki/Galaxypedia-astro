The **_Blizzard_** is a powerful [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) that was introduced in the [Christmas Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017), but was re-introduced in the [<span style="color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;">Christmas Event 2022</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2022).

## Description

The Blizzard is an extremely large [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) that carries 4 Unique [IceFyre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}IceFyre) Fighters.

This Ship excels at being a flagship in a fleet due to it's health, firepower, and speed, and the diversity of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) it has, having extremely high turret firepower for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Appearance

The Blizzard is one of the largest and widest ships in the game, even bigger than some [Super Capital Ships.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) and dwarfing every other [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in size.

The Ship has a futuristic, snow theme with many, many complex detailings around it. On its back has a large amount of engines, along with 2 extremely large fins around its side, supporting the ship. On the sides can be seen the 2 Hangars with each carrying 2 [IceFyre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}IceFyre) fighters. On the front has its signature yellow ball, which was a reference to its previous model.

Its interior sports a large room with many icy decorations like icicles on its ceiling. There are 3 Seats, with the middle being the pilot seat.

## Advantages

- Large health pool.
- Despite it's size, it is fast with a top speed of
- Has very high firepower for a carrier, allowing it to destroy other large [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) even without the assistance of its fighters.
- Can support itself very well even without its Fighters.
- Has long range turrets with a range of up to 6800.
- Fighters can shred shields from their spinals.
- Great for supporting fleets with its high health and large firepower.

## Disadvantages

- Large [Blindspots]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Terminology) underneath and on the back of the ship.
- Extremely Large, making it very easy to hit with spinals and any turrets.
- Struggles to fire all turrets at once, unless pointing directly at its target.
- Limited carrier, making you a large target.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.
- When fighting with the Blizzard, try and stay pointed to your opponent so all your turrets have a line of sight.
- If you have to fight, stay below and pointed at the enemy so majority of your turrets can fire, and take down [AA]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) Ships with your turret firepower like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) and [Hyron]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyron) which can shred your [Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}IceFyre).
- Beware of swarms of small [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) that can overwhelm the Blizzard.

## Trivia

- This was the first [Christmas Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017) limited ship.
- Was the only carrier to exclusively have [Dragonflies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragonfly).
- The **Blizzard** was originally named the Snowstorm, but the name was changed.
- Due to the name of the ship being changed, the error message "This model is too big for Roblox to handle" was displayed as a placeholder. This has since been fixed.
- Many players sold the **Blizzard** to gain more [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits); however, most of them didn't realize that it was gone until the [<span style="color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;">Christmas Event 2022</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2022).

- The second event Carrier, the first being the [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx).
- Funny enough, back in the days when this was available, the ship was deemed weak and so it was sold by a lot of the people who got it back then, for about 40k.
- The remodeled version has an orb at the front of the ship, similar to the [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova), [Reaper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Reaper), and the [Grim]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim).
- The original **Blizzard** model was meant to be a [Revelation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revelation) remodel made by ARiNA.
