The **_Retro Nyx_** is a [Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) [**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) added during the [Retro Ship Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2021).

## Description

The **Retro Nyx** is a limited version of the original [Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx) featuring the ship's old model, and [original fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Nixesion), some of the stats are somewhat different than the Nyx (e.g. higher speed, higher total health, etc.).

## Appearance

The Retro Nyx is a large, long, flat carrier that is identical to the iconic first model of the [Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx).

A teleporter at the back leads to bridge, which contains the pilot seat, and the teleporter to the hangar.

The **Fighter Bay** is a long hangar housing 8 [Nyxesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyxesion) fighters and a door leading to the <u>**Interior**</u> that contains 10 seats for players and the teleporter to the bridge.

## Advantages

- Huge total health, at 28000 total health (and the damage resistance of 55%).
- Relatively high acceleration, turn speed, and top speed for it's class.
- Relatively high Cargo Hold (1000).
- Large death explosion can easily destroy all smaller ships in range (~5000 studs).
- One of the highest DPS carriers in the game with fighters, standing at a monstrous 1367.26 DPS, rivalling that of [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx) and [Kapisi]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kapisi).
- One of the best ships for sieging bases and destroying large capital ships with its fighter swarm.

## Disadvantages

- Players can easily swarm an undefended **Retro** **Nyx**.
- Extremely large.
- Huge blindspot underneath the ship and a small blindspot behind the ship.
- Extremely expensive, costing an exorbitant amount of 3.5 million credits and an additional 250 alpha parts.
- Without its fighters, it is almost unable to fight any ships that it engages, making it defenseless, even with its enormous health.
- Will be hunted due to being a limited ship.
- Low turret DPS compared to other limited carriers.
- Very expensive to fill up its fighter's with AI pilots costing 3000 robux or nearly 2 million credits without VIP to fill.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust.
- **Never** overestimate the ship's health, as a coordinated fleet could easily shred your ship.
- It can be used as a support [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in sieges by carrying [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to distract enemy [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), as well as providing great support from its large fighter swarm.
- The Retro Nyx can be used as a decent tank as it has more health than some [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) ships but this is not recommended as the Retro Nyx is a limited carrier and will be targeted and hunted.
- Warp in, release fighters, then immediately warp back to your strongest starbase.
- Extremely powerful in taking down NPC Bosses.

## Version History

- Turnspeed reduced from 0.25 to 0.17, Health reduced from 16500/14500 to 13500/12000 in version .73a3
- Retro Heavy Laser count reduced from 3 to 2 in version .73a3.
- Health increased from 13500/12000 to 16000/12000 after the event ended.
- Interior reverted to original Nyx interior but this caused the ship to be unable to turn rendering it useless until a fix.
- Interior reverted to original interior and thus allowing to be turned rendering it actually capable of combat in version .73f.

## Trivia

- **yname** was the first to lose this to **yname's Starbase**.
