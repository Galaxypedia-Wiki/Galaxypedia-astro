The **_Rhino_** is a large, durable and heavily armed **[Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)**.

## Description

The **Rhino** is the fourth largest [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in the game and has the second most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) excluding limited carriers. The Turret placement allows for decent defense from any side of the ship except underneath.

## Appearance

The rhino is remodeled, all descriptions and images are currently inaccurate.

## Advantages

- Large amount of [Frenzies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frenzy) and [Strikers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker) combined.
- High health.
- The fighters possess incredible combined firepower if used in a swarm.
- Variety of accurate [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Fairly low [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse) requirement.
- The carrier itself can provide decent pest control support.
- One of the best [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) for fighter support.

## Disadvantages

- Vulnerable underside and rear.
- The carrier itself is weak against ships of its size.
- Poor maneuverability.
- Large profile makes it a big target.
- Has a low [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) count.
- You'll need an entire team that is willing to fly the fighters.(If you don't have AI fighters)
- Equipping all fighters with AI pilots is relatively costly, costing 2500 robux without VIP.

## Strategy

- Use the high Fighter count to swarm bases and opposing Ships.
- The Rhino itself can provide good support against small, fast ships due to all turrets being flaks and PDLs.
- The **Rhino's** exposed underside, slow speed, sub-optimal Turret types, and awkward handling means it will need support from a fleet, or a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) to survive any dedicated assault.
- When [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging), stay out of range of the base but turn sideways towards it to allow faster Fighter release. Also, bring some [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) and [Destroyers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) as escorts to defend against the [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) that may counterattack.

## Version History

- After being added, the **Rhino** received a remodel in an unknown version.
- Health buff in .65b
- Health increased from 8000/7250 to 11000/8000 and loadout changed to 4 Light Flak Cannons, 1 Light Laser, 2 Heavy Flak Cannons, and 2 Heavy Point Defense Lasers in version .68d.
- Replaced 4 Frenzies with 4 Strikers in version .73a3.
- Health decreased to 10000/7000 in version 75a5.

## Trivia

- Used to be one of the only Carriers with non-solid Fighter bay doors. Because of this, players could walk through the doors and even pilot small ships into the **Rhino**. This has since been removed with the new interior remodel, although players can still pilot small ships into the **Rhino** with proper timing.
- Named after the species Rhinoceros.
