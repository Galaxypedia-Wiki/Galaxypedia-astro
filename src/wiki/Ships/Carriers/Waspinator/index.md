The **_Waspinator_** is a limited [**Carrier-Miner**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) hybrid released during the [April Fool's Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2022).

## Description

**The Waspinator** is an April Fool's-themed combat miner carrier with [Wasp?]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp?) [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) and Mining Lasers as weaponry. ![[Wasp?]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp?) Fighters engaging
an enemy
ship.](WaspinatorSwarm.png "Wasp? Fighters engaging an enemy ship.")

## Appearance

The Waspinator is identical to the model of the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp), but made extremely large, to the point where it is bigger than most [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). There is a floating teleporter on the far front of the Carrier, and leads to a teleporter just infront of the pilot seat. ![Teleporter leading to the entrance of

The Fighter bay is simply a row of [Wasp?]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp?) Fighters lined up above it's engines.

The Interior is identical to the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp).

## Advantages

- The **Fastest and Most-agile [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)** in the game, with an astounding 0.60 Turn Speed, which is as fast as [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).
- Turret is long range and extremely accurate, capable of hitting even [Cruisers.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers)
- Intimidating.

## Disadvantages

- Low hull-based DPS.
- Huge, and can be hit easily with [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry).
- Expensive.
- Low health for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Strategy

- Keep this ship as a trophy.
- Abuse the 9K turret range of Wasp? against ships (can also be used to anti-seige if enemy is too scared)
