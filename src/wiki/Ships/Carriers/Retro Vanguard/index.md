The Retro Vanguard is an Event Carrier for the [Retro Ship Event 2024]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Ship-Event-2024).

## Description

(dont have r van someone pls fill this in)

## Interior

(dont have r van someone pls fill this in)

## Advantages

- Incredibly small, meaning most ships will not be able to hit this.
- Around 400 turret dps, allowing it to defend itself well even without the use of fighters.
- Small icon on the minimap, meaning most ships wont see you.
- Only 2 fighters, making it viable if you don't have many ai fighter slots.

## Disadvantages

- Rather expensive, costing around 2.5 million credits.
- Low health for a carrier, however that is expected for a ship its size.
- Is unalbe to tank like most carriers.
- May be asked to despawn as this carrier underperforms in dps against most carriers, like the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator).

## Strategy

- Use this ship to attack lone miners, annoy big ships or dive something that is low, as its small size will keep you relatively safe.
- Try To avoid AA ships such as [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos), [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest), [Aedes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aedes) and [Oblivion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Oblivion) as much as possible, as their AA can deal a lot of damage to you.
- Use its small size on the minimap to your advantage by surprise attacking players.

## Version History

- Added to the game in .77d29.
