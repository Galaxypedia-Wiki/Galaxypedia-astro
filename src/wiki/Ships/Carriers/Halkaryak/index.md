The **_Halkaryak_** is a [**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) added during the [2021 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).

## Description

The **_Halkaryak_** is the first carrier in the game to be vertical. It shares a similar model to the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream), [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) and [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr). It shares design traits with the [Revenant]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revenant).

## Interior

The interior for both bridge and fighter bays are very basic:

- **Bridge:** A brown box that consists of a pilot seat, a teleporter, and a wall of text that mocks the nature of the lazily made interior.

<!-- -->

- **Fighter bays:** Three narrow brown boxes that contain one [Sin]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sin) each, with a dynamic rippling forcefield in front of the fighter. The boxes are so small that the player barely has room to jump when the [Sin]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sin) is inside.

## Advantages

- High overall health.
- Very high damage-per-second to shield.
- Fast considering its size and class.
- One of the highest turret damage-per-second stats of all carriers.
- Sins have somewhat high and balanced health.
- Very slim, making it hard to hit.
- Sins have extremely high individual damage-per-second against hull, having a volley of 24 Small Cannons each.
- No blind spots.
- Pairs well with the fighters, as the ship does high shield damage, while the fighters do high hull damage.
- Relatively cheap to equip all fighters with AI fighters, only costing 750 robux without VIP.

## Disadvantages

- Fighters mostly deal hull damage, making them weak against shield-based ships unless used together with the carrier, and vice-versa.
- Low fighter count, only having 3 [Sins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sin).
- Low Cargo Hold for its class.
- Very expensive.
- Inaccurate turrets

<!-- -->

- Will be hunted due to it being a limited ship.

## Strategy

- Use this ship in fleets, not only due to its lack of hull damage, but also because this expensive carrier is a huge target for pirates.
- Focus fire on larger ships so all of your turrets can hit, decimating enemy shields.
- Use your slim width and speed to strafe shots coming towards you.
- Pair up with hull-shredding ships such as the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker) to become the perfect ship-destroying duo.

## Version History

- No logged changes.

## Trivia

- Vaguely looks like the <s>Naglfar</s> Tornado from EVE Online.
- Is called a **''Bow''** by most players.
  - Many people find this ship incredibly ugly.
