The **_Nimitz_** is a unique **[Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)** that has a major emphasis on [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) and their firepower.

## Description

The **Nimitz** is a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)-based [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) carrying three different fighter variants; the [Interceptor F]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Interceptor-F), the [Foxfire]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Foxfire) and the [Instigator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Instigator).

**Nimitz** has a large range of accurate [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) for hunting down small ships or while standing ground to cover a retreat or allow time for [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) pilots to arrive.

## Appearance

The Nimitz is a long carrier that has a strong resemblance to the ship its based on; [The Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:USS-Nimitz) but with a futuristic steampunk like ship design added to it like the addition of ship Thrusters on the front and back of the ship, additional fins jutting out of the ship, along with an unusual carrier runway. There is a text that says ***"*Death To UNE*"*** written on a part of the ship, similar to the one found on [Naglfar]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Naglfar).

The Nimitz has one of the largest interiors in the game, spanning 3 floors, with numerous hallways connecting each one, which can make the player easily lost. The top floor features 3 Rooms. First is the Bridge, which features the pilot seat, along with a holographic globe behind the seat. On the side of the bridge is a holographic table with multiple shapes on it. The second room is an empty room with a table in the middle, The third room is a living quarters full of beds. Two floors down, is where the cargo bay and the hangar can be found, which span the entire underside of the ship. The cargo bay is the largest room in the ship, with multiple containers around the area, and doors that access the Hangars of the fighters found on the side of the Nimitz.

**Fighter Deck**

The Fighter deck spans almost the entirety of the ship deck, with multiple fighters docked on top of it, and at the side. There are also fighter decks located on the side of the ship, which can be accessed via the cargo bay.

## Advantages

- Carrier itself has accurate [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) for fending off small ships.
- Variety of powerful [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Large amount of powerful [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) gives it incredible damage potential.
- Extremely high acceleration for it's class.
- It has an explosion radius of 1250, rivaling that of [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) nukes and can **destroy full health [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)**.
- Has the highest Fighter [DPS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang) of any [BM]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) Carriers at a monstrous .

## Disadvantages

- Large blind spots near the sides and under the ship.
- Almost defenseless without its fighters against capital ships or swarms.
- Sacrifices firepower for [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- VERY high cost to equip all fighters with AI pilots, costing 3250 robux in total without VIP.
- It's extremely powerful nuke will be a threat to your own fleet/team when your ship is destroyed.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship alone. If you do so, travel with a heavy escort that you can trust, as your low health will catch up to you if you are [Dived]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Slang).
- Make sure you use the [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) against the same target.
- The runway can be used to easily land and regroup [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) without recalling them, or for a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to flee from a small ship.
- Use your high accuracy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to defend yourself and your [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) from smaller ships.
- It can be used as a support [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in sieges by carrying [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to distract enemy [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), as well as providing great support from its large fighter swarm.
- [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) can support and protect your carrier from blind spots.
- Pre-organize a group of players large enough to utilize most of the fighters on the Nimitz prior to spawning it, such as over a discord call or community group. A coordinated team gathered into the Nimitz fighters can create a swarm capable of demolishing virtually any opponent, even [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) like [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and [Super Capitals.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships)
- Warp in, release all your fighters and warp out as soon as you can to your nearest or strongest Starbase.
- If you think your ship will be destroyed, Warp your ship away as **far as possible** from your own fleet or starbase as the nuke has a whopping radius of 12,500 studs, and if possible, you can warp to the enemy's fleet or starbase to bring the nuke there instead.
