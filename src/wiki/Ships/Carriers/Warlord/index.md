{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Warlord_** is a small [**Carrier**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) / [**Dreadnought**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) hybrid focused more on [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower than [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Description

The **Warlord** is an assault type [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers), with versatile [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and a squadron of small, nimble [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) called [Raptors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Raptor). This versatile ship is ideal at either back-line support or for facing other [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) head-on when it's caught in the fray.

## Interior

The interior of the **Warlord **is a small grey room containing the pilot's seat and two teleporters leading to the left and right hangars. The interior is very buggy as you can walk through many walls.

## Advantages

- Versatile and well-placed [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Powerful and unique [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Large Cargo Hold making for an ideal (yet unconventional) [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) ship.
- Ability to engage in combat without the use of its fighters.
- High Shield damage, able to fight [Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) and the [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) it calls by itself.
- Relatively cheap to equip all fighters with AI pilots, only costing 1000 robux without VIP.
- Relatively small compared to other Carriers.

## Disadvantages

- Low Fighter count.
- Has 2 blind spots, specifically towards the back and bottom of the [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- Sluggish.
- Fighters have <u>very</u> low health.
- Aiming all the turrets can be difficult at times.

## Strategy

- The **Warlord** is useful for a spearhead attack if you are accompanied by other [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships).
- Thanks to its [Heavy Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), it is able to defend itself from smaller ships while also being able to engage larger ships. 
- You could play it like a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), that is engage your enemy head on, as it has high DPS and high health pool.
- OR you could be back-line support, have your fighters attack other ships while using your turrets for self defense.

## Version History

- Added in version .65b.
- Health increased from 5750/5800 to 9100/8700, 4 light cannons replaced with 4 [Heavy Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in version .68d.
- Health reduced from 25000/24000 to 21000/20000, 1 Triple Heavy Laser replaced with 1 Triple Medium Laser, Average DPS (with fighters) 449 -> 442 in version .77e14

## Trivia

- This ship, for now, has the most amount of transparent textures of any Carriers.
- Shares an extremely heavy resemblance in terms of design to the [Marauder]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Marauder).
- Almost identical to the Daedalus from Stargate (Most likely the inspiration).
- Made in [The Cultist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Cultists) shipyards.
