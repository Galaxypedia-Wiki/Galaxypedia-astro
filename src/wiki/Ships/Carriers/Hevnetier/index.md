{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Hevnetier_** is a fairly large [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) made by the [Slarfie]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slarfie) with a focus on [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and it's special [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)-like [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).

## Description

The **Hevnetier** is a large [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) that is fairly mobile for its size. There are two empty hangars to the left and right of the ship. The front of the ship contains its [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)-like fighter, the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis)

## Appearance

The **Hevnetier** has a simple interior, being a box with a screen at the front, containing a stool that is the pilot's seat, two more seats for fighter pilots and four teleporters. The one at the back leads to outside of the ship. The ones on the left and right leads to the respective hangers. The one at the front leads to the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis).

## Advantages

- Has a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) comparable to a battleship.
- Well armed for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- Good support ship for fleets and sieges.
- Has little to no reliance on using [AI Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI-Fighters), as only 1 player is needed.
- High [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- Cheap for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Disadvantages

- The Carrier itself lacks [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- Rather low [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage compared to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.
- Has the lowest fighter count in the game, a total count of **1**.
- Turrets may have a hard time hitting small ships.
- Sluggish.
- Huge blind-spot under the ship.
- Rather low health for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Strategy

- It can be used as a support [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) in sieges and fleets by itself and carrying a portable [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) to engage against capital ships, as well as providing defense against smaller ships.
- Useful in fleets, as it provides an extremely powerful and disposable Fighter.
- Get a skilled pilot in the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis). You are now just a dreadnought with 7 turrets, congratulations.
- The low shield DPS of the carrier can be offset-ted by the high shield DPS of the [Elanis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Elanis) and vice versa.
- Engage ships that are above you as all of the turrets can fire at once.
- Only fight in this ship with a fleet, as small, agile ships can easily exploit your blind-spot under you.
