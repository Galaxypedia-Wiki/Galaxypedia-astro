The **_Nyx_** is one of the largest ships in Galaxy and has one of the highest health totals out of all carriers, along with the highest fighter dps of all non-limited [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

## Description

The **Nyx** is a large, flat Carrier with a massive health pool and the fourth most [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) in the game. Contrary to what many may believe, the **Nyx** has decent firepower for a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) but functions leagues better with fighters than without.

## Interior

Upon entering the bridge you will be teleported to an empty black box with the pilots seat and a teleporter back to the dock. A second teleporter will take players to a small but detailed and well-lit fighter bay which contains 8 [Nixesions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion).

## Advantages

- Extremely high firepower from the [Nixesion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters).
- Large cargo hold. (1000)
- Relatively large explosion value of 410 (4.1k stud radius) can easily destroy all smaller ships in range, and even some smaller [capital ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships), provided their health has been sufficiently crippled first.
- Decent [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- The fighters alone possess incredible combined firepower far exceeding that of the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), and the **Nyx** has enough turret firepower to defend itself against most ships even without the use of its fighters.

## Disadvantages

- Players can easily swarm an undefended **Nyx.**
- Very large.
- Tied with many other ships, such as the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) and [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker) as the slowest ship in the game.
- **Very** expensive compared to other [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
- **Massive** explosion size could result in death towards friendly ships. (410 radius)
- Can easily be destroyed by multiple [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- This ship requires multiple people to properly protect and use to deal proper damage.
- Unreliable without AI Fighters.
- Expensive.

<!-- -->

- Inexperienced pilots will have a hard time piloting some [Nixesions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) out of the hangar of the **Nyx** due to the edges of the wings being clipped inside of part of the hangar itself.
- Many blind spots due to the size of the ship.
-

## Strategy

- **Always** travel in a fleet to ensure maximum effectiveness.
- Make sure you have a team that will listen to you so they can teleport on board to pilot the [Nixesions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion).
- Bait and Switch: Warp Into a dangerous zone, tell pilots to enter the [Nixesions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) and then warp out of the zone leaving the [Nixesions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nixesion) to deal with whatever you encountered.
- When attacking this ship, warp as fast as possible away from the explosion to avoid becoming nuked.
- A **Nyx** at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) with multiple factions will almost always gather a fleet with the purpose of defeating it.
- Avoid AA ships such as the [Mjolnheimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mjolnheimr) or [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) - their accurate turrets will shred your fighters.
- If the enemy faction is sieging, try to use your own fighters to defend the base.
- Though the **Nyx** is capable of tanking, always be ready to escape or despawn, as being dived could easily lead to death due to the **Nyx's** low mobility and firepower. Never overestimate the vessel's health.

## Trivia

- One of the most-used carriers in the game, mainly due to its nuking capability and extreme health distribution.
- Originally had no turrets.
- In the newest update, it and the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) received turrets.^(When?)^
- This original ship is based on the Gallente Federation Supercarrier [Nyx](http://eve.wikia.com/wiki/Nyx), in Eve Online.
- Came out during the [Rogue One event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Star-Wars-Event).
- It used to be the bulkiest ship in game before the [Prototypes]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes) came out.
- This ship was one of the 5 chosen to be remodeled for the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017), with its remodel, the [Ghoul Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghoul-Nyx), being a stronger, transparent version of the original.
- **Nyx** was the Greek goddess of Night and Darkness.
- Largest ship upon release.
- Was the most expensive non-event ship in the build menu until [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus) came out, save for a short period of time upon the release of the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) in which the [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) costed more, nowadays, [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) along with [Nimitz]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nimitz), [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus) and [Revelation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revelation) are more expensive than it.
- The original model had a rather detailed interior, with it even including a cafeteria room. Sadly, it was eventually removed due to lag.
- The [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) and [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus) were both released as more costly than the Nyx, and were both intended to be stronger than the **Nyx**(and all other [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers)) upon their release, but despite that, the **Nyx** has remained the most powerful and reliable non-limited carrier since it was released originally.
