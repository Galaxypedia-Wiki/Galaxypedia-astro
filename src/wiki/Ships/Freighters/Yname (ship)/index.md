- It was only available for 1 day.
- Before its explosion radius was nerfed, its nuke caused the loss of ships like the [United States of Razor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-States-of-Razor), and the [Nightmare]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nightmare).
- There was a bug where a Class D Permit was accidentally added to the **yname**'s cost for a short period. A few players fell victim to this and lost a million credits as a result.
