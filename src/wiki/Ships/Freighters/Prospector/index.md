{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Prospector_** is a light [**Freighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) with a focus on [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health.

## Description

The **Prospector** is a [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)-Class ship that has the fifth highest cargo capacity for its class. It is slightly faster than the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules), making it a good choice for traders who want a faster ship as a backup for the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules).

## Appearance

The **Prospector** is entered through a metal door on the back that leads to a larger room. To the left of the entrance is a set of three crates, a bed, and a small nightstand with a decal and lamp on it. Stairs to the right of the bed lead up to a bridge with a decorated pilot's seat and three yellow screens.

## Advantages 

- Faster than the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules).
- 6th largest Cargo Hold of all [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters).
- A good choice for those that like to trade safely, as smaller [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) are targeted less often.

## Disadvantages

- Somewhat slow.
- A target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Low health for its price.

## Strategy

- Make sure to trade in a neutral [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}factions) that hopefully has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have [Factions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) all at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), try [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) close to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) instead.
- Go to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a war. There might be a [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) or two waiting for you.
- Check how far away the closest [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}aliens) is and where it is heading.

## Version History

- Received buffs in .61e4 that doubled [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), and gave the ship *some*damage resistance.
- Buffed in .65b - [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) increased from 700 to 1200, [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) increased from 1050 to 1500, Cargo Hold increased from 1000 to 1750, price increased somewhat. Also received a remodel.
- In version .75a10, the ship was put offsale.
- Unretired in version .76d

## Trivia

- You can make back what you spent buying this ship quickly by [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading).
