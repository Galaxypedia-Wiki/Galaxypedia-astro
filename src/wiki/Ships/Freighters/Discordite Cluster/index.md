The **_Discordite Cluster_** is a unique **[Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)** given to people that boosted the [Galaxy Discord Server](https://discordapp.com/invite/FCGGXvk).

## Description

The **Discordite Cluster** is a limited freighter that looks like an arrangement of light pink-colored crystals jutting out in one direction, looking similar to a comet or asteroid. The **Discordite Cluster** has a long pink trail with what appear to be sparkles along with it.

## Interior

There is a seat inside the comet which a driver can sit on.

## Advantages

- Incredibly fast speed, highest speed out of any Freighter in the game.
- Excellent health pool with more health than the [Prepravca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prepravca).
- Great for vulturing.
- Most of the design is not solid, giving the vessel a tiny hitbox.
- You don't have to keep boosting the server monthly to keep the ship.

## Disadvantages

- Costs $4.99 a month to have a server boost.

## Strategy

- Use your fast speed to be able to avoid pirate fire and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Only use this in specific situations, use a regular Freighter for regular activities.
- Utilize this ship's tiny hitbox and incredible mobility to go close to enemy [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and loot wrecks. Do not try that strategy on players, due to the likelihood of it being dived.

## Version History

- Added on 6/19/19 with a post on the Official Discord Server showing how to obtain it.
- Stopped being distributed on 8/18/20 due to conflicts with the Roblox ToS.
- Shields reduced from 3500 to 2500, Hull reduced from 3500 to 2000, Cargo Hold reduced from 3000 to 2475, Top Speed reduced from 250 to 200, Acceleration reduced from 50 to 40 and Turn Speed reduced from 0.45 to 0.35 in an unknown version.
- Was made available again on 3/12/21 (version .72b).

## Trivia

- The only way to obtain this ship is "for those that have Nitro Boosted the [discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/FCGGXvk)".
- The first player to have their **Discordite Cluster** destroyed was Nighthunter313 to a VC fleet.
- Only one of these was given to someone who did not boost the discord server, and that was u00854, who was the first person that found the [Remains of U.N.E Starbase 12]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Remains-of-U.N.E-Starbase-12).
- Selling the **Discordite Cluster\*** grants the player 127,303 credits.\*
