{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Wyrm_** is a tiny **[Freighter]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:Freighter)**automatically given to new players.

## Description

The **Wyrm** is a free ship automatically given to players when first joining the game. If it dies, it must be rebuilt manually in the ship build menu under the [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) tab. This ship is used to transport materials or loot wrecks.

## Appearance

The Wyrm is a small, rounded ship featuring a pair of small wings and tail fins. It has a cockpit with a single seat at the front, and a small but relatively detailed interior. The pilot's seat has team-colored padding and the seat faces a set of three blue screens below a glowing cylinder, suggesting the screens are holographic projections. The middle of the ship is dedicated to cargo, with a non-functional access door modeled underneath. The rear of the ship has a single small thruster for propulsion.

## Advantages

- Easy to begin [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) with.
- Easy to control.
- High top speed, acceleration and turn speed.
- Small and hard to hit.
- Great for salvaging small wrecks.
- Not much of a target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- It's free.

## Disadvantages

- Small cargo hold, so the profit from [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) is minimal.
- You will lose any cargo you are carrying if you die.
- Low health.

## Strategy

- Make sure to only [Trade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) when your team is not at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
  - You can check if your team is at war using the [Diplomacy Menu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Diplomacy-Menu).
- Go to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), there might be a [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) waiting for you.
- Check how far away [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) are and where they are heading to.
- You can afford to take some risks with this ship as it is free to rebuild. However, note that you will lose all the cargo you were carrying upon destruction.

## Version History

- Added in version .34.
- Made a free ship and given to new players starting in version .56.
- Received a remodel in version .65b.

## Trivia

- Each new player is given a [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) and a **Wyrm**, if they are destroyed they can be rebuilt for free.
- In previous versions of the game, the **Wyrm** used to require resources to rebuild upon destruction. This has since been removed.
- There is a modified version of this ship called the [Worm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Worm) that features basic weaponry and some additional armor to increase the [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health from 300 to 500, at the cost of the cargo hold being 100 instead of 250, the [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) being 200 instead of 300, and the loss of safe docking.
- Has a limited event counterpart, the [<span style="color:#8dfc80">Festive Wyrm</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wyrm) that somehow has over nine times the Shield and Hull health, and ten times the cargo hold.
- The ship emits a long lavender trail.
