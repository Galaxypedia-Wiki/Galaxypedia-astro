{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Argonaut_** is a cheap but fragile **[Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)** that favors shield health.

## Description

The **Argonaut** is the third tier trading ship of eight total. It usually is obtained after the [Tempura]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempura) although usually skipped to get better ships. This ship has more health than then [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm) and Tempura, but is still relatively fragile. [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) and [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) are easily able to obliterate it, the latter more so. It also has a recognizable hexagon shaped windows in the front part of the ship.

## Appearance

The **Argonaut**has the same chair as many other freighters, as well as four team-colored crates in the back. The chair faces a set of three yellow screens.

## Advantages

- Decent cargo hold for the stats.
- More health than the [Tempura]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempura).
- The small figure on the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) makes you less likely to be noticed by [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Rather cheap.
- Fast.
- Armed.
- Relatively small.

## Disadvantages

- Low health.
- Low turn speed.
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) find [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) to be easy targets and cheap ways to make money.
- Docks slowly.
- Low [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) compared to shield.

## Strategy

- Make sure to trade in a [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) that is in no wars and has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have wars, try your best to be safe.
- Go to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a war, there might be a pirate waiting for you.
- Check how far away the closest [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) is and where it is heading to.
- Always check your trade route, there could be a pirate waiting for you anywhere.
- Good for trading at war, high speed makes it hard for most ships that could kill you in time to keep up, small price means lower target, though you may want to try a Tempura for this.

## Version History

- Received a buff in .61e4 that doubled hull and shields and gave the ship _some_ damage resistance.
- Cargo hold buffed from 750 to 1,250 in .65b, price increased, and received a remodel.
- Cargo hold was buffed slightly more from 1,250 to 1,500 in version .75a10.

## Trivia

- Players usually skip this ship to get a higher tier [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters).
- One of the few Freighters to be armed.![Original Argonaut model by
