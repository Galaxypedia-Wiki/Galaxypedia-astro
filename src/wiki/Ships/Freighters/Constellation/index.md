{{< notices/vipShip >}}

The **_Constellation_** is a medium sized [**Freighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)-class ship. It formerly had no armament, due to the removal of all armaments from armed freighters (except [Carvainir]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Carvainir), which was moved to [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)).

## Description

The **Constellation** is a large [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters), the only one to be armed. The **Constellation** is a [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) ship. The ship is remodeled, until then the images and description of this are outdated.

## Appearance

To enter the **Constellation's**interior, step on a teleportation pad located on the back of the ship. Once you are inside, you will be greeted by a slate grey slightly rectangular room with a black "pilot's seat" (brick) in the middle of the room.

## Advantages

- Large cargo hold.
- Can easily make large amounts of [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) per run given a good economy.
- High [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields).
- Good acceleration.
- The only armed freighter in the game.

## Disadvantages

- The ship's large width and relatively slow speed make you a prized target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) using bigger [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Expensive and requires VIP.
- While this ship is armed, the armament is so weak that it can hardly defend itself from an experienced [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) pilot.

## Strategy

- Check the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) often so you can warp away from any enemy [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) if needed.
- If anything stronger than a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) attacks you, retreat to your [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or to a safe area _as soon as possible!_

## Version History

## Trivia

- One of the only freighters in-game to have armament.
- In etymology, the name is the word for a group of stars that form a pattern in the sky.
- It was the 2nd [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) ship to be temporarily available to all players before being restricted to [VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) players only.
- You used to be able to unconventionally destroy other [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) and [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) ships in the **Constellation**. Technically, you could even raid a base or a planet!
- It was one of the four [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) with [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), the other being the [Patriotic Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Hercules), [Carvainir]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Carvainir) and the [C Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}C-Class).
- Although it was supposed to be the first armed [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters), the [Carvainir]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Carvainir) was designed for the same purpose. The Carvainir however, was classed as a [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) due to its high firepower.
- The remodel made it significantly smaller and harder to hit.
- The remodel was based on the Babylon Five "Icarus" Delta-Class, not to be confused with the [Icarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Icarus) [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).
