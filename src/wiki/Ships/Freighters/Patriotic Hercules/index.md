The **_Patriotic_** **_Hercules_** is a limited redesign of the old **[Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules)** model.

## Description

The **Patriotic Hercules** was Galaxy's representation of America for adding guns to literally everything, as it used to have 4 [Medium Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). Different from its predecessor, the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules), the **Patriotic Hercules** carries a bigger Cargo Hold.

## Interior 

The interior is the same as the old [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules), apart from color changes.

## Advantages 

- Higher health than the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules).
- Bigger cargo space than [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules).
- 1500 More total health than the regular [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules).

## Disadvantages 

- A bit slow.
- Doesn't carry an adequate amount of Cargo Hold to make up for its steep price tag.
- It will make you hunted by [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}pirating) who want to destroy your limited ship.

## Strategy

- Always check your [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) and avoid [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), everyone wants your event ship killed.
- Treat this as a trophy, only spawn it to show off and never spawn it during a war.

## Version History

- No logged changes.
- 4 [Medium Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) removed in version .71b.

## Trivia 

- Was released along with the [Patriotic Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Rorqual).
- Released as a [Limited Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ship for the [Fourth of July Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Fourth-of-July-Event-2018) celebration.
- Was the second armed [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) in the proper [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) category, with the first being the [Constellation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Constellation).
