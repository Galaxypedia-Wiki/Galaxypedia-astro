The **_Tempura_** is a light **[Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)**.

## Description

The **Tempura** is a cheap and small [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) with triple the Cargo Hold of the starter trade ship, the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm). It is useful for cheap trading and scavenging. Its relatively high maneuverability makes it good for looting and escaping, though its health is rather low.

## Appearance

The **Tempura's** interior is quite large for a [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) its size. The entrance contains the cockpit with a control panel and doorway to the engine room, which has assorted boxes and the engine.

## Advantages

- Easy to obtain.

<!-- -->

- Moderate Speed.
- Better than the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm) across nearly all stats.
- Very cheap.

## Disadvantages

- Low Cargo Hold in comparison to other Freighters.
- Low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), making it easy to destroy.

## Strategy

- It is recommended that you get this after the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm), however, you can also choose to skip this in favor of [Argonaut]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Argonaut) due to its higher capacity for a negligible speed decrease.
- Make sure to trade in a [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) that is in no wars and has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have [Wars]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), try your best to be safe.
- Go to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a war. There might be a [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) waiting for you.
- Check how far away the closest [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) is and where it is heading.
- Go to high-ore wrecks and head to [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) or your base for a good profit.

## Version History

- Received a buff in .61e4 that doubled [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) and [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and gave the ship *some*damage resistance.
- Cargo Hold buffed in .65b from 500 to 750, price increased slightly.

## Trivia

- In etymology, the **Tempura** is named after a Japanese seafood dish and is also another name for the "Prawn".
- [Duck Blox]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Duck-Blox)'s remodel was live for 10 minutes before it was reverted.![Old Tempura
