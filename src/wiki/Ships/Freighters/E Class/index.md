{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_E Class_** is currently the largest**[Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)Â **in the game.

## Description

The **_E Class_** is a massive [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters). It is rather lacking in health and resistance, despite being larger and more expensive than some dreadnoughts, however it has a huge cargo hold (totaling 12,500) and is remarkably fast for its size.

## Appearance

The interior is largely confined to the cockpit. A hallway with a teleporter can be found at the back of the ship, leading to the cockpit, which consists of a main walkway leading through the cylindrical room, ending at a seat with panels surrounding it. There is an image at the back of the room of what appears to be a screenshot of the cockpit, with wreckage that can be seen out of the window, however it is difficult to determine the contents of the photograph due to its small size.

## Advantages

- Largest Cargo Hold in the game; It is double the [Prepravca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prepravca)'s Cargo Hold and forty times larger than the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm)'s Cargo Hold.
- Very high health for its class.
- Can easily make thousands of [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) per run even if the [Economy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Economy) is poor, so long as there are enough [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) for you to buy and enough credits at another base for you to sell.
- Somewhat fast for its size.
- Docks as "Safe" at bases, meaning it is completely invulnerable when docked.
- Strong nuke at an explosion radius of 500, which can wipe out small or crippled [Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}capital-ships) that get caught in the blast.

## Disadvantages

- Low damage resistance.
- Terrible acceleration and turn speed makes it hard to escape quickly.
- Extremely expensive for a [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters).
- Very vulnerable alone.
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) consider this ship the ultimate target since it's slow, defenseless, extremely expensive, and it often takes a long time to dock at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) compared to most ships.
- When trading, finding enough [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) can be an issue.
- Can break the [Economy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Economy) after a few trades, limiting its effective usage.
- Takes time to make back the amount of money it costs.
- Easy to get caught on things (such as asteroids) due to its size.
- Rather long, making it easy to hit with [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) and [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets).

## Strategy

- Never trade while in a war to avoid being destroyed, as you are very vulnerable to attack. If it is vital that you trade, use smaller, cheaper freighters instead, such as the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules), as even with an escort you are still taking a huge risk.
- Care should be taken to avoid surprise wars being declared mid-way through a trade run, as it may struggle to dock in time if poorly positioned.
- Check the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) often for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Stay next to friendly combat ships.
- <s>This ship is an effective tool for VIP servers especially when trying to do a low player count eco server. Refer to the [trading tab]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) on how to set one up.</s> Removed VIP servers in an unknown update.
- If you get stuck in the Mega Base, **DO NOT MOVE** **AND DO NOT TRY TO DOCK as**it might cause your ship to fling. instead, calmly wait for your warp to charge, then warp away. If being attacked when becoming stuck, use a screen recorder, so you may provide your video to the Admins and potentially get your ship refunded if it is destroyed during the bug.

- Remodeled with a newer version of its original model, and explosion radius increased from 200 to 500 in (unknown version please add).
- Cargo hold was buffed from 10,000 to 12,500, top speed was lowered going from 60 to 50, turning speed decreased going from 0.11 to 0.10; this was carried out on .75a10.

## Trivia

- Has the highest Cargo Hold of any build menu ship as the [C Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}C-Class) technically has the highest.
- Second model is now the [D Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}D-Class) model.
- One of the only ships to be 'reverted' to a retro model.
- The "Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster" mentioned in its description is a reference to the novel 'The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy'.
- Possibly based on the Bulk [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) from 'Endless Sky'.
- Stands for Economy Class.
- Referred to as the "Toilet Brush" by the community.
- This ship is an expensive yet effective nuke (purposefully placing your ship into a situation where it will be destroyed, with the intention of the ship's explosion doing massive damage to other nearby ships).
- The ship's current model has a secret teleporter in the interior that teleports you outside of the ship, some 20 or 50 studs to the rear of the entrance teleporter, This allows you to despawn the **E Class** quicker than most other ships, provided you know where the teleporter is.
