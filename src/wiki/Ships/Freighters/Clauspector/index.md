{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Clauspector_** is a redesigned version of the [Prospector]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prospector) [**Freighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) made for the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018) .

## Description

The **Clauspector** shares its chassis with one of the [Prospector]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prospector)'s old models. It's color scheme has been changed to fit the holiday. It has neon Snowflakes for engines and is draped in Christmas Lights.

## Interior

The **Clauspector **has a very simplistic interior. In front of the teleporter pad you will find a simple pilot seat positioned behind the windows located at the front of the ship. Behind the teleporter pad you will find presents stacked up to the ceiling along with the logo decals of the 3 people who made it.

## Advantages

- Decent health.
- Fast top speed.

## Disadvantages

- This is often seen as a jackpot for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Defenseless.
- Mediocre cargo hold.
- Once lost, it can **NEVER** be re-obtained.

## Strategy

- Do not use this ship during [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War).
- Do not travel alone.
- <s>Don't travel without your Christmas spirit and snowballs.</s>

## Version History

- Added in Version .65b.
- Removed in version .75a37

## Trivia

- The presents in the interior are currently broken and have been for the past 2+ years.
- The in-game description says Hercules instead of **Clauspector**.
- Has a Cargo Hold greater than [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) like the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules), but not as much storage as the [Prepravca]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prepravca).
- It's one of the two [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018) ships to not be made out of snow or ice, instead being made out of white wood.
- The description of the **Clauspector** spells the word "receiving" wrong.
