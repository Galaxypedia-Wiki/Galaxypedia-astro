{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_C Class_** is a **[Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)** which was going to be awarded to first and second-place winners of the [Galaxy Tournament](https://challonge.com/GalaxyAT).

## Description

The **C Class** is a large Freighter that resembles an old model of the [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class). It is also the largest Freighter in the game with 2.5x the cargo hold of the E Class while also boasting a bit over 3x the E Class's speed. On top of it all, the **C Class** is also one of the few Freighters to be armed. This ship was going to be awarded to first and second-place winners of the Galaxy Tournament, however after being inactive for the longest time, it was finally announced that the Tournament was being discontinued. The **C Class **and [Lykos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lykos) will never be distributed or even added to the game.

- The Best [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) in the game.

## Disadvantages

- Limited classification means that if you lose this, you cannot get it back unless there is a refundable issue.

- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) consider this ship their ultimate target even if it's fast, defensive and has more health since this ship is **very rare** to see.
- The player must win the [Galaxy Tournament](https://challonge.com/GalaxyAT) in order to get this ship.
- Can break [Economy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Economy) after a few trades, limiting its effective usage.
- Easy to get caught on asteroids due to its size.

## Strategy

- Don't use this for [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) during war, unless you are confident you will not die as you will be targeted.
- Treat this ship like it's a trophy.

## Version History

- Removed in version .69a2, due to the cancellation of the tournament.

## Trivia
