{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Prepravca_** is the third largest buildable **[Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)** in the game behind the [Constellation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Constellation) and the [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class).

## Description

The **Prepravca** is a heavy duty [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) with the third highest Cargo Hold of all buildable [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters). It's very slow and has a large, flat body, making it a big target for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).

The main portion of the ship has five large cargo crates, two large side thrusters, and a bubble-like bridge with team-colored glass. This ship can make huge amounts of credits when you used in sync with a large miner like the [Rorqual]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rorqual) or [Mammoth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mammoth).

This is effectively the largest [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) in the game for most players until they gain enough credits to buy the [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class) (or the [Constellation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Constellation) for players with [Galaxy VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass)) as the price difference between the **Prepravca** and those ships are massive.

## Appearance

The **Prepravca's** interior is identical to that of the [Prospector]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prospector). The **Prepravca**has a decent interior. If you step through the door, there are some stairs to the right next to some crates and a bed. On the upper area, there's a pilot seat with some neon control panels.

## Advantages

- Third largest buildable [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) Cargo Hold in the game.
- Decent health for a [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters).
- Good cargo hold.
- Decent turn speed.

## Disadvantages

- Slow Acceleration and low Top Speed.
- Fairly expensive for a [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters).
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) consider this ship a floating gold pile since it's slow, defenseless, and is almost always seen with a fully loaded Cargo Hold.

## Strategy

- Remember to never trade while in a [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) to avoid being destroyed, as the **Prepravca** is very vulnerable to attack. If it's vital that you use it in a war, bring an escort.
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) are more likely to wage war on you if you are seen repeatedly using this ship, so be careful when players with high [Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty) are on the server.
- Bring this to a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) post-siege and you will most likely be able to loot the [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) in one run. If possible, try to fly in a "fleet" of [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters).
- When looting a siege, be extremely careful and always have an escort whenever possible, even when docking at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

## Version History

- Rebalanced in .52d, gaining 500 extra Cargo Hold, but losing 100 [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and a bit of mobility.
- In update .53, according to [Trello](https://trello.com/b/E0bIEAyS/galaxy), it was reduced by 800 parts due to the lag it caused during warp. It now docks relatively fast and is more optimized.
- Received buffs in .61e4 that doubled [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull), and gave the ship minor damage resistance.
- Received a remodel in version .65a.

<!-- -->

- Buffed in .65b - [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) increased from 2500 to 3000, [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) increased from 1500 to 2500, Cargo Hold increased from 2500 to 5000, price increased significantly. Also received a remodel.
- Cargo hold buffed, increasing it by 2,000 units from 5,000 to 7,000 in version .75a10.

## Trivia

- In etymology, the name derives from the Slovak word, '\*Prepravca**\*' which** means 'the transporter', which is a fitting name for this large [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) ship.
- The current model of **Prepravca** is similar to a [Bulk Ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulk_carrier). A common ship used by merchants for trading Ores.
- Its current model looks like an elongated [Prospector]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prospector) or one half of a [D Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}D-Class).
- **_Please update the images for old models - Drivethecar54_**
- Has the same amount of health as the [Patriotic Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Patriotic-Hercules).
