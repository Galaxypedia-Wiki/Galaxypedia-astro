{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_D Class_** is currently the 2nd-largest [**Freighter**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) in the game. [Excluding limited freighters]

## Description

The D **_Class_** is a massive [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters). It has a moderate amount of health and resistance, despite being more expensive than some dreadnoughts, however it has a huge cargo hold (totaling 7,500) and is remarkably fast for its size.

## Appearance

Features the same interior as the previous [E-Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class) model.

## Advantages

- has 30x the cargohold of the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm) and has 3x the cargohold of the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules).
- good health for its class.
- Can easily make thousands of Credits per run even if the Economy is poor, so long as there are enough Ores for you to buy and \*enough credits at another base for you to sell.
- Somewhat fast for its size.
- Docks as "Safe" at bases, meaning it is completely invulnerable when docked.

## Disadvantages

- Low damage resistance.
- Terrible acceleration and turn speed makes it hard to escape quickly.
- Extremely expensive for a Freighter.
- Very vulnerable alone.
- Pirates consider this ship the ultimate target since it's slow, defenseless, extremely expensive, and it often takes a long time to \*dock at the Mega Base compared to most ships.
- When trading, finding enough Ores can be an issue.
- Can break the Economy after a few trades, limiting its effective usage.
- Takes time to make back the amount of money it costs.
- Rather long, making it easy to hit with spinals and turrets.
- Large target.

## Strategy

- Never trade while in a war to avoid being destroyed, as you are very vulnerable to attack. If it is vital that you trade, use smaller, cheaper freighters instead, such as the [Hercules]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hercules), as even with an escort you are still taking a huge risk.
- Care should be taken to avoid surprise wars being declared mid-way through a trade run, as it may struggle to dock in time if poorly positioned.
- Check the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) often for [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).
- Stay next to friendly combat ships.
- This ship is an effective tool for VIP servers especially when trying to do a low player count eco server. Refer to the [trading tab]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) on how to set one up.

## Version History

- Hull nerfed from 6,000 to 4,000 hp in an unknown version.
- Shield nerfed from 3500 to 3250 hp in an unknown version.
- In version .75a10, this ship was put offsale.

## Trivia

- Resized version of the old e-class, probably because lazy devs. (Info needed on version history).
- This ship is not used often cause most people skip it and go straight towards [E-Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class).
- The first person to lose there d class was DayJYA to PotatoLord_58's Retro Commercial Miner.
- The first kill with a d class was by PrestonTheTiger1 who killed sharkFace1222's Banshee with the ships nuke.
- D class freighters have died least compared to all other freighters except for limited freighters.
