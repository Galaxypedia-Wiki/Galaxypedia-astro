The **_Toy Mega Base_** is a [**Freighter-class**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) ship found in one of the gifts at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) during the [2020 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2020) and could have also been built during the [2021 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021) in the build menu.

## Description

The **Toy Mega Base** is a smaller, simplified replica of the [Christmas 2020 mega base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Mega-Base). It features red and green windows, neon parts, and plating. Some windows and features normally seen on the Mega Base have also been removed to keep the ship small and to remove complexity that could cause performance issues.

## Interior

The **Toy Mega Base** has no interior; pilots sit on a seat positioned above the mini-observatory.

## Advantages

- High cargo hold.
- Overall high health for a freighter of its size.
- It's small, making it hard for ships to hit.

## Disadvantages

- Limited, making it an excellent target for pirates & players.
- Somewhat slow.
- The C-class permit requirement makes it very expensive to re-obtain if lost.

## Strategy

- Make sure to trade in a [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) that is not at war and has strong allies. If there are none, go to a new server. If all servers have wars, try your best to be safe.
- Go to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) when it is safe. Always check your route if you're in a war, as there might be a pirate waiting for you. If there is, stay at your base.
- Check how far away the closest [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) is and where it is heading to.

## Version History

- In .69a1, it was added to the 2021 Christmas Event. It was available in the build menu under 'freighter'.
- Cargo Hold increased from 2000 to 2250 and Acceleration doubled in version .70a.

## Trivia

- Unlike the full-sized [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), the interior of this resized Mega Base is completely empty.
- The total health of this ship is the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base)'s total health divided by 20.
