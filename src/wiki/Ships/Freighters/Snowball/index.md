The **_Snowball_** is a strange-looking quest **[Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)** released during the [Christmas Event 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2019).

## Description

The **Snowball** is a giant floating snowball ship released for 3 days on the 25th of December as part of the [Christmas 2019 Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2019).

## Interior

The interior of the **Snowball** is practically non-existent. It is comprised of see-through walls, and a text box containing the following message: "Merry Christmas, Shadiris!"

## Advantages

- Fast.
- Large cargo hold.
- Good vulture ship.
- Small icon on minimap, making it harder to notice.
- Extremely hard to hit.
- Extremely cheap for a ship that is tanky, fast, and high cargo hold.

## Disadvantages

- Limited - you can't get it back if it's destroyed.

## Strategy

- Don't use this ship during conflict or in a public server where it is at risk of being destroyed; treat it like a trophy, as it can never be obtained again if lost.

## Version History

- Cargo Hold reduced from 2935 to 2500 in an unknown version.

## Trivia

- Released at 6:30 EST Christmas morning.
- The first person to lose this was Preauri, who was killed by spacefighterboss in a [Retro Grievion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Retro-Grievion).
- The ship was obtained by a two-part quest: First, players accept a quest from the Mega Base pedestal. Then, they need to find Sean in his cabin as the second vendor that actually gives players the ship.
- The original Cargo Hold of the **Snowball** was a reference to SCP-2935.
- Has similar stats to the [Discordite Cluster]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Discordite-Cluster).
- Many players initially lost it due to a scam that the ship could be sold for money, and claimed from the quest multiple times.
- <s>Of course it has low health, it's made of snow!</s>
