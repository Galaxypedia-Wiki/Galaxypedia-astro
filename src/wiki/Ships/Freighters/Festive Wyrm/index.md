## Description

The ship has some Christmas decorations on it, including a Santa hat, two wreaths, and some Christmas lights strung on it. The ship was also recolored and had its stats changed.

## Appearance

The **Festive Wyrm** has the same tiny interior as the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm), with the only difference being the change in color.

- Good Speed to Cargo Hold ratio.Â 
- Very good at vulturing.
- One of the best Freighters in the game when it comes to overall stats.

## Disadvantages

- Once lost, you cannot get it back.
- [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) are more likely to target you.

## Strategy

- Use your speed to get to loot and run away before [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) can even get to you.
- Use your high speed and tiny size to dodge enemy fire.

## Version History

- Added in .65b.
- Fixed part-shift .75a12

## Trivia

- If you were to kill one and the player had 0 [Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty), you would gain 27,137 [Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty).
- If you were to sell this [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) you would receive 81,410 credits for it.
- Unlike the [Festive Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Wasp) and [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp) giveaway during the [Christmas Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017), players could re-obtain the **Festive Wyrm** after selling it between the two days it was being given away.
- Despite the rumors spread about the Festive Wyrm not appearing on the map, the **Festive Wyrm**, in fact, does appear on the map. This rumor was most likely started by a pirate attempting to lure the ship into a false sense of security and kill it.
- Despite the fact that there is a [Coal Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Coal-Wasp), there is no Coal Wyrm.
- Used as a "Viper" during sieges to Speed Tank bases, after the base dies, you can be the first one to loot the base.
