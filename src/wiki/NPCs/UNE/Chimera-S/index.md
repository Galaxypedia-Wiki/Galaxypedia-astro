_This article describes the NPC ship. for the weaker, player-obtainable vessel, see [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera)._

The **_Chimera-S_** is a friendly [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ship that passively hunts [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) ships.

## Description:

The **Chimera-S** is an upgrade to the standard [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera) Destroyer. It is, however, an AI ship and cannot be acquired by players. It has substantially more health and firepower and a higher top speed than its build menu counterpart, though it has less acceleration. It appears to be a newer version of the [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera) that is currently in [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) service.

## Behavior:

The **Chimera-S** is often seen wandering around the map until it encounters a [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) ship. If it encounters one, it will start to attack that ship, regardless of how big said ship is, calling for reinforcements as it does so. The **Chimera-S** alone could beat a [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) or even be a match for the [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bruiser), however it is no match for a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher), but the **Chimera-S** may stand a chance when it calls in reinforcements.

## Strategy

Allow the **Chimera-S** to distract the [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) ships, while attacking them from further away than the **Chimera-S**, allowing you to remain mostly undamaged.

## Loot

- The **Chimera-S** drops 140 items of loot including 87 silicate, 46 carbon, and 7 iridium.

## Trivia

- Due to the presence of the **Chimera-S**, many people feel safer when mining.
- It belongs to the first new AI Faction in years
- First U.N.E. NPC ship introduced.
