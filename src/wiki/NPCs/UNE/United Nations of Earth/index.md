## Description

(For U.N.E Lore Click **[HERE]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E-Lore)**)

**_The U.N.E_** are one of the only three [AI]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) Factions in the game, the other two being the [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) and the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall)/[Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens). The U.N.E is also the only AI Faction in the game that is passive towards players.

The U.N.E's base of operations is a [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) called the [U.N.E Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E-Starbase) and has a navy blue color along with the territory it occupies.

Any ships affiliated with the U.N.E faction will have a Navy Blue color to them and will attack any ship that is affiliated with [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) or [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), at a minimum of 13,000 studs away from them.

New players who have just started playing Galaxy will be automatically be joined inside the U.N.E faction so as to have protection from [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).

**Notes:**

- _U.N.E cannot have a player leader and cannot be warred by any factions, no matter the circumstances._
- _<s>U.N.E Starbases and ships **DO NOT** spawn in private servers and only do spawn in public servers.</s> Private servers do not exist anymore, hense this info being outdated._
- _<s>U.N.E Starbases can assimilate NPC Bases but **NOT** Player Starbases.</s> Changed in an unknown version, Player bases **CAN** be assimilated now_
- _<s>Strangely, the U.N.E Starbase can be assimilated, given enough territory from a faction, this also allows the faction to own the U.N.E AI ships, meaning that at war they can attack and players can attack them back.</s> Changed in an unknown version, Can't be assimilated anymore._
