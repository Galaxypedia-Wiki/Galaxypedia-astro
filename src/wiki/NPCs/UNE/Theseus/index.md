The **Theseus** is a [U.N.E]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}u.n.e) [Quest]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}quests) [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) released during the [Halloween Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2023).

## Description

The **Theseus** is a ship capable of entering the Rift, purpose built to be upgradable and made to withstand significant punishment from enemy ships within the Rift. It comes with a unique [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) that heals its [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) HP rapidly over a short period of time if the [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) are down, or heals [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) if the [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) is full. The Theseus also comes with a good variety of weaponry for destroying medium to large ships. It is part of a ship line, which is as follows: [Theseus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus), [Theseus-U]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-U), [Theseus-E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-E), [Theseus-K]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-K), and finally [Theseus-X]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-X).

## Appearance

The ship's profile is well defined, aside from it being clad in turrets. Its engines protrude from the back of the hull and form a flat segment protected by hull shielding around the top and bottom to both the left and right side. The plating is a dark grey or lighter black color, which covers the majority of the hull; and is not affected by team colors. It has a spinal mount at the front between two prongs, which is where its spinals are located (more to be added, WIP).

## Advantages

- Can be upgraded through a series of quests after being obtained, starting with the armor upgrade that increases the ship's health ([Theseus-U]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-U)) all the way to a substantial upgrade to the ship's [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) ([Theseus-X]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-X)).
- Can resist to an extent, damage when its [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules) is active with the healing that provides.
- High damage output on its weapons makes dealing with enemy capital ships within the Rift easier.
- High HP allows you to tank for your squadron while doing excursions within the Rift.

## Disadvantages

- Somewhat expensive to obtain for the first time.
- Not very flexible line of sight on the turrets, preferring that you face your targets if you wish to have full line of sight.
- Most of the turrets struggle to hit small or nimble targets, leaving this ship vulnerable to smaller, more maneuverable ships meant to take out capital ships.

## Strategy

- While doing excursions within the Rift, help out your other squadron members if they have weaker ships by tanking some damage for them.
- If using the ship outside of the Rift, be mindful that others may target it as it is very valuable.

## Version History

- Released in unknown version.

## Trivia

- This ship line is similar to the Preos (i.e. [Preos Adult]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Preos-Adult), [Preos Juvenile]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Preos-Juvenile)) series of ships, but different in that upgrades through the quests consume the previous ship.
- This ship has weaponry that is unusually high-end for a ship of its type and cost.
