The **_Scourge_** was a unique [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) ship added during the [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020)

## Description

The **Scourge** is the [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020) equivalent of the Alien [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher).

## Armament

The **Scourge** is armed with 3 Huge/Large(?) [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), and 8(?) Custom Cannon [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It is not that powerful on its own; it cannot fire its turrets directly ahead because of a bad mounting angle. This is the assumed reason for its secondary spinal weapons.

## Strategy

The **Scourge** has a huge blind spot behind it. By exploiting this blind spot, some players have been able to solo it with nothing but a Frigate or Destroyer (like an [Aura]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aura)) Doing so allows players to solo these ships and keep their loot to themselves.

As with [Alien Servs]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Serv) and [Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher), distractions with small, fast ships like the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) and [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco) are effective ways to draw this ship's fire while pest-controller ships with high-accuracy turrets deal all the damage.

It is relatively easy to brute force the kill with any ship, as there is a blind spot directly behind it where it cannot shoot you.

## Loot

- [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores): 425 Silicate, 344 Carbon, 224 Iridium, 11 Adamantite, 30 Palladium, 17 Titanium, 17 Quantium, and 5 Uranium.
- 10 [Gamma Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gamma-Pumpkin).

## Version History

- Gamma pumpkin drop rate nerfed in version .69a1 20 -> 15
- Buffed in version .69b5, being able to call Alien Servs to help it against enemies.

## Trivia

- For the first few days, it does not appear to call any Alien Servs or other **Scourges** to its location when attacked.
