## Description

The **Kneall Outpost** is an [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) that was added and only spawned during the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event). It has 2 variants, **Phase 1** in the Part 1 of the event and **Phase 2** in Parts 2 and 3 of the event.

The Kneall Outpost is an extremely large asteroid with 2 docking hubs that have many [Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) docked around it. It can be seen from across the map due to its size.

## Phase 1

The **Phase 1 Kneall Outpost** was an extremely large, unarmed starbase that is the **tankiest** [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) in the game with a total of 1,000,000,000 shields, making it virtually indestructible, no matter how large a sieging fleet is.

The [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) had a green color on the map, and constantly spawned [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) around it at a much faster rate, including the [Kneall Prototype]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Prototype).

## Phase 2

The **Phase 2 Kneall Outpost** made the [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) no longer function as one, but rather a giant structure instead for 2 [Quests]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quests) _([THE KNEALL]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}THE-KNEALL) and [Reverse Engineering]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Reverse-Engineering))_. It also no longer spawns [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), nor does it make them stay near the structure.

Phase 2 made the Kneall Outpost have an extremely large portal on-top of it, and has one [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator) wreck, two [Chimera-S]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera-S) wrecks, and two [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement) wrecks near it, suggesting a recent battle at the outpost, possibly a siege.

## Trivia

- The Starbase, and entity in the game with the highest health in the game, at a total of 1,000,000,001 Health.
- One of the only Starbases to have a different, non-functioning variant.
- There was a similar Kneall structure during the [Halloween Event 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020) called the _Kneall Production Facility_ where you could obtain the [Revenge]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revenge) located in a teleporter inside [The Rift]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Rift).
