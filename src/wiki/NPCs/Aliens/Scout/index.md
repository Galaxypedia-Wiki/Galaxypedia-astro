The **_Scout_** is an AI [**Alien**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) ship made by the **[Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall)**.

## Description

The **Scout** is the [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) equivalent of a [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates)/[Fighters|Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) and is well known for annoying [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) and [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters). It is mostly black with large neon areas and has a bottom-mounted and top-mounted [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).

## Behavior

**Scouts** will attempt to stay around 3 to 4.5K studs away from whatever they are attacking and may move below [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) to maintain their turret's line of sight. When attacking a slow or stationary target, they are often seen moving back and forth in mostly straight lines. They have a tendency to go underneath Ships to make it hard for main [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to hit.

**Scouts** will always answer a call from an [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) or Alien/Kneall Boss when it is attacking any player or Starbase. Hordes of **Scouts** can easily overwhelm players and starbases, even if said player has a battleship or dreadnaught, they are know to cause serious damage. When the Punisher they are called to is destroyed, **Swarmers** will either start to scatter, go to another nearby Punisher (if there is one), continue to attack the Punisher's target, or drift slowly away from the location.

Scout sare more likely to attack [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) and [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters), so stay alert.

## Strategy

Due to their significant dps and high top speed, **Scouts** are best attacked using ships with high-accuracy [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). Light and Medium-sized [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), aside from Railguns, best fit these guidelines.

## Loot

**Scouts** drop 3 Snowflakes and 25 alien parts.

## Trivia

- After decoding the description, it reveals to say "From beyond light comes the blessing of decay"
- Has a Laughable Explosion value of 8
- The **Swarmer**has no trail.
- If the player that is attacking them [Warps]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive) away, they will likely not follow and will go away, or if in a fleet, scatter.
- Scouts are often seen as nuisances more than threats to many players (although can still be dangerous in fleets or against low-health [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships).
- Unlike the Swarmer, Shadowstrike and Cranefly, there is no limit to how many can be spawned in a server at any time. However, the alien spawn limit of 20 still applies.
- Received a nerf in the spawn rate, due to them spawning too quickly and overwhelming entire servers.
