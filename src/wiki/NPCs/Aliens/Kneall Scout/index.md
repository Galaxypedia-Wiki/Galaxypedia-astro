The **_Kneall Scout_** is an **Alien** AI ship and part of the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) Fleet.

## Description

The **Kneall Scout** is a Kneall fleet ship added in an Alien AI update, along with a few others (like the [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Bruiser) and [Outrider]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Outrider)).

## Behavior

Moves in the same way as other Alien AI ships, warping a random amount, then turning and warping again.

**Scouts** will always answer a call from an [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) when it is attacking any player or Starbase. Hordes of **Scouts** can easily destroy [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), even if said Starbase is the maximum level. They will either start to scatter, go to another nearby Punisher (if there is one), or move away from the location when the Punisher they are called to is destroyed.

**Scouts** are more likely to attack [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) and [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters), so stay alert and look at the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) often when [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) or [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading).

## Strategy

Almost impossible to hit with spinals, as the **Scout**is smaller than most ships in the game. Use AA ships like the **[Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest), [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos), or [Loyalist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalist).**

Even when using these ships, the pilot has to be at point blank range (200 studs or less) to have a high chance of actually hitting the scout. This will most likely entail warping, as the **Scout**is 4x as fast as the Loyalist, and 7x as fast as the Tempest.

## Loot

5 Silicate, 3 Carbon, and 5 Alien parts.

## Trivia

- The Scout was originally intended to be a mining drone.
- A crashed Kneall scout can be seen in what appears to be a shield generator on Myriad.
- Until recently, they were one of the only two Kneall Fleet ships not to spawn randomly, with the other being the [Kneall Prototype]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Prototype), which still doesn't randomly spawn.
- Doesn't actually scout enemy vessels, but acts in the same way the **Swarmer**does.
- After its removal, it returned in the form of 4 admin ships that share the same model: **[Key]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Key)**, **[Key1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Key1)**, **[Key2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Key2)**, and **[Key3]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Key3)**.
