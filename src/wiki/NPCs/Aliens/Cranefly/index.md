The **_Cranefly_** is an [Avellian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian) AI Battleship that was introduced as an alternative to the [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) in the [Christmas Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021).

## Description

The **_Cranefly_** is an [Avellian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian) ship that has a unique design, somewhat resembling the real-life [Crane fly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:Crane-fly) in the way that its thin body leads on to a long snout. It is similar to its playable counterpart, the [Solstice]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Solstice), in power and health. The same model is used for both ships.

Just like the [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher), it will call all other aliens to its location when under attack by a player or another AI ship, making it particularly difficult to deal with.

## Strategy

- A singular **_Cranefly_** can be beaten by mere frigates due to its slow turnspeed and inaccurate armament.
- Try to use a shield-heavy ship against it (such as the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement)) as the **_Cranefly_** sports a hull-shredding loadout, or use a speedy swarm of smaller ships as to not get hit at all.
- Recommended not to attack alone if a number of other [Aliens]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations) are in the server.
  - Alternatively, lure to a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) with a fast ship and draw their fire while the base's weaponry shreds the fleet.

## Loot

- Drops 30 Snowflakes.

## Trivia

- One of the only NPC [Avellian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian) (and by extent [Slarfie]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slarfie)) ships in the game, the others being the [Scout]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Scout), the [Shadowstrike]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shadowstrike) and the [Adversary]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Adversary), all introduced in the same event.
