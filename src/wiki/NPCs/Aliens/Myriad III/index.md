**_Myriad_** is the smallest [Planet]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:planets) in Galaxy.

## Description

**Myriad** is the smallest and weakest planet in Galaxy. It has a brown atmosphere and a desert-covered surface. The planet is also covered in the ruins of an [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) facility and some crashed Alien ships. Small groups of Alien Script can also be seen throughout the facility. Inside the facility is a small, damaged doorway that leads downwards into a series of tunnels.

Whichever faction's territory covers the planet first assimilates the planet as their own. Whoever brings down the planet's health to zero will take over **Myriad**.

**Myriad** can be upgraded twice. The first upgrade (Level 2) costs 12,000 credits and adds 1000 health to both Shield and Hull, adds some visual changes around and inside the facility, adds a ladder to the [Alien Computer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Computer), adds teleporters from the docking ports to the facility, and adds one medium railgun. The second upgrade (Level 3) costs 24,000 credits and adds 1000 more health to both Shield and Hull, adds a new hangar on the surface that releases [Swarmer Prototypes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer-Prototype), adds further visual changes to the facility/surface, and adds 8 custom heavy railguns.

## Climate

The climate of **Myriad** is a hot desert with constant sandstorms covering the planet. No life exists on the planet, and the abandoned buildings suggest that the planet had a large alien facility, possibly a refinery or research station.

## Duna'kaé

During part three of the Celestial Bodies update(s), a moon was added in orbit of **Myriad.**The moon is named _"Duna'kaé"_ and is supposedly the home of a dormant (or inactive) volcano. The moon's volcanic activity and excessive heat have left the surface flat and tough. The moon has a similar atmosphere to **Myriad**, but it is a bright red as opposed to **Myriad's** brown. **Myriad**'s moon _Duna'kaé_ also contains a [Quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Richard-Kavar) which requires you to obtain 5 Data Archives, a very rare and expensive artifact that can be found drifting through space in random locations or bought at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). Most players with access to mid-tier miners should be able to afford them if bought. The reward for completing this quest is only 15,000 credits, so most players do not do it, as Artifacts are very rare items.

### Climate

The climate of _Duna'kaé_ is very hot and is unable to support life.
