## Description

The **_Harvest King_** was a Boss [NPC]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) ship added during the [2018 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018). It was MUCH more powerful than the infamous [Grim Reaper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim-Reaper) featured in 2017's Halloween event. It featured powerful [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) not found on any other ship called [Harvest Super Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It also featured [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) with high rates of fire like those found on the [Alien Harvest Servitors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Harvest-Servitor).

The **Harvest King** was the primary source of [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) used to create event [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), dropping around 30 after being destroyed. The **Harvest King** would also drop 1 [Ghost Pumpkin]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghost-Pumpkin) after being destroyed; this particular pumpkin was used in a quest given by the [Grim Reaper (NPC)]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}<Grim-Reaper-(NPC)> "wikilink"). The **explosion** of the dying **Harvest King** could deal a whopping **2,500+** damage to ships as far as 4.5k (10k on its final form) studs away. Like with a destroyed [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership) or [Prototype]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes), it was recommended that all [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) nearby warp away as soon as the explosions start.

## Alien Harvest Servitors

The **Harvest King** arrived in the server with two or three [Servitors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Harvest-Servitor) alongside it. These ships share the same symbol as [Alien Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), but with an orange coloring instead of light green. They cannot call other Aliens to their location, making soloing them a viable strategy. Most players will attempt to destroy these before engaging the **Harvest King.**

Like [Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), [Servitors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Harvest-Servitor) can occasionally spawn naturally in the server, providing a somewhat steady source of [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) (2Â per ship).

## Strategies

Like regular [Alien Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), the **Harvest King** can call all other Aliens in the server to its location. This can create incredibly deadly swarms, which is why many players target the [Servitors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Harvest-Servitor) or [Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) already spawned.

Use Starbases to your advantage. An incredibly powerful strategy is to lure the **Harvest King** to a Level 5 [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership) and have it distracted by the [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership) or a small frigate while attacking it. Beware, if it has a powerful enough fleet in the right position (at the aft of [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership)) the **Harvest King** will overpower it, but it will be heavily damaged afterward.

Use the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base)'s SAFE dock:

Lure the **Harvest King** to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) where a player's ship is docked and the **Harvest King** would target it without doing any damage. Then, the rest of the players can safely attack it while the **Harvest King** and other [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) are distracted.

Another strategy is to let a decently fast enough [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) distract and dodge the lasers of the **Harvest King** while a more powerful fleet moves in to destroy the **Harvest King**. However, the **Harvest King** has about 350 speed, so it is advisable to use a [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco) or a [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper). It is advised never to fly in a straight line, as it is possible for the **Harvest King** to catch up to you and finish you off with its incredible spinal aim. As the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper)/[Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco), it's best to fly in circles where there is a rare chance of the **Harvest King** landing a hit on you. Remember **never** to go too close.

Ever since the **Harvest King** reached its final form, ships like the [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco) or the [Dragon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragon) have become too slow, thus making them unsuitable to outrun the King.

## Stage III/Final Form

On October 30, the **Harvest King** reached Stage III of its evolution, or its final form, at which the firepower of its [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) increased further. It became faster than ships like the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper), so if you were trying to lure it, you had to warp constantly in the direction you were going so you didn't get outrun by it.

It also changed in design - the red neon parts changed to a pink color, and the "fins" changed color from red to gold.

Once it had reached its final form, the **Harvest King**dropped 1 [Ghost Pumpkin]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghost-Pumpkin) and 25 [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) once killed. It's explosion damage was increased so drastically that it was capable of destroying a level 3 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) upon death, and its explosion radius had been increased from 6k to 10k studs.

## Trivia

- The name "Harvest King" likely comes from the association of Halloween with the harvest season.
- The **Harvest King** was made by lightning9160, under the name "Judicator".
- The **Harvest King** grew powerful after achieving Stage III in its final evolution, while the [Harvest Servitors]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Harvest-Servitor) weakened from the King's evolution.
- The **Harvest King** had a grand total of 18 turrets, whereas the turret cap for obtainable ships is 10. Due to this, and having an extremely overpowered armament, it is able to destroy a full hp archeon in 2 salvos.
- A video of a **Harvest King** battle taken by Glowstone_Guy can be seen here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2qiYO0rbec>
