_This article describes an NPC ship. For the player ship with a identical appearance, see [Preos Hatchling]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Preos-Hatchling)._

The **Plagued Preos Hatchling** _(Shortened, "**Hatchling**")_ is an Alien ship added during the [2021 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).

## Description

The **Plagued Preos Hatchling** looks similar to the [Preos Egg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Preos-Egg), but has 4 floating sphere [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and is mostly green and dark green in color.

## Behavior

## Loot

- 3 Preos Bits

## Strategy

- You can probably take this on with most ships, but watch out because these can swarm you.
- These Hatchlings give between 2k-3k credits and are easy to kill, making them an excellent source of credits
- Use a ship with high hull damage to kill the Hatchlings (the [Nautilus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nautilus) is an excellent choice with its high hull damage from the 6 large cannons, large cargo hold and high speed and tank)
