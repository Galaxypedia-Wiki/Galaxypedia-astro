**THE KNEALL ARE COMING!**

</h3>
## Overview

The **Kneall event** is an event that started in May 28th, 2022 and concluded at June 6, 2022. It introduced new ships, a large [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) base, and a new mini-boss.

### **Part 1**

- Introduced a large [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) base "[Kneall Outpost]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Outpost)", which had an enormous amount of health and spawned large amounts of [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) near it, that is located roughly 30k studs away from [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).
- The [Kneall Prototype]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Prototype)'s spawns were enabled and spawned every 120 minutes but stopped spawning after the conclusion of Part 1.

### **Part 2**

- Introduced 2 new ships in the game, the [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher)-based counterpart, the [Onslaught]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Onslaught) and the most well-known ship added for the event, the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator).
- Introduced the new Alien mini-boss, the [Kneall Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Brawler), and the [Devastator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastator), which was an extremely powerful [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) which itself significantly increased the spawn rate of ships like [Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer), [Bruisers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bruiser) and [Outriders]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Outrider). The Devastator base is famous for having an absolutely devastating nuke, capable of destroying entire fleets in a moment.
- During this part there was a _very_ significant increase in [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) ship spawns in public servers, this also included ships like [Sovereigns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sovereign-X), [Judgements]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement) and [Subjugators]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E-Subjugator).
- The [Kneall Outpost]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Outpost) was also no longer a functional [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) but instead, was made a portal for the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) Fleet to come and invade from.
- Planets were removed midway into Part 2 due to players using them as bait for [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) to attack. Some Planet-based [Quests]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pyramus#Quests) were moved to [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) due to this.
- Many [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)-class ships' HP nerfed.

### **Part 3**

- Nerfed [Devastator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastator) to the point where it could be soloed by a skilled player, but the loot was also nerfed from 1m+ to 248k.
- [Planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) could now spawn again naturally in the map and [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) nerfs reverted.

<!-- -->

- Re-released the [Disruptor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Disruptor) and [Brawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Brawler) in the Non-Limited Build menu.
- _Kneall Event concludes after this part._

## Trivia

- Kneall Core was one of the loot in [Devastator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastator), which was the material needed to build the [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator), and could only be obtained once via a [quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Last-Signal). This made [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator)non-limited during the event.
