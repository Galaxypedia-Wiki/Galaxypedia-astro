## Description

The **_Devastator_** is a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) affiliated with the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) added in the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event). It is the strongest [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) to date, formerly [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership). It has a total of 65,000 health. Taking it head on is a guaranteed death sentence as it's overwhelming turret firepower **will** gun you down no matter if you're a Small [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) or a large Capital ship and it regularly spawns large alien fleets, making it risky to siege the base unless you have an powerful siege fleet with multiple [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) and/or [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).

The Devastator can spawn in Private servers with a minimum player count of only 1, though it is much more difficult to destroy as [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth) fleets don't spawn in private servers.

It has a <u>**massive explosion size**</u> of **40k+ Studs**, rivalling that of [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership) and [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), and has destroyed numerous extremely expensive ships like an [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal) or a [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer).

It's wreck drops the materials needed to build the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator).

## Strategy

There has been a recording of a multiboxing strategy. It is blunt, but effective. (It is also costly):

it requires:

1 Nimitz, Prototype X-1, and a Prototype X-2. (The Nimitz must have all AI fighters, too.)

by simply launching all fighters, and letting the X-1 and X-2 camp behind it, it can successfully kill a devastator. (Nimitz stays out of range)

As of the 3rd of June, Devastator had been heavily nerfed. Its DPS is nerfed to that of a level 3 Myriad (still a lot, but way easier to kill without the help of UNE). It is quite possible to kill a devastator with 2 Nyx or 2 Annihilators in a private server.

With Annihilator, warp into the range of the Devastator (preferably around 4.6k) and then release fighters. Tank for the fighters for as long as possible, run when you drop to around 6k to 5k shield. If your base is close enough, you may send fighters in while you're repairing. It is also advised that you warp directly behind devastator and release your fighters there, as both you and your fighters will be able to tank for longer.

For Nyx, dump the fighters at 10k range then go back to base. Respawn and repeat once all fighters have died.

It is advised to kill off the aliens around the Devastator before you head in using your carriers. The easiest way to do so is to lure a punisher/bionicle to your base.

## Trivia

- Even though the ship cannot spawn in as a starbase anymore, it can be spawned by admins via commands. It spawns as an alien ship, and only starts warping and looking around when hulled.
- A smaller, heavily nerfed version of this Ship/Starbase exists and is called the [Annihilator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator)

<!-- -->

- **NEVER** use any ship that you cannot afford to lose against the Devastator. As of right now, there is no player obtainable ship (including Prototypes, confirmed by an admin) that can survive the Devastator nuke. And the nuke is very fast, you only have slightly more than 20 seconds to run from certain death.
- It is, without a doubt, the strongest naturally spawning AI Base in the game.
- The Eradicator is still stronger than the Devastator in a 1v1.
- Its total turret count is somewhere over _33, LITERALLY ALOT_
- When Devastator first got released, it dropped around 2 million credits worth of loot. However, the amount of loot it drops had since been cut to a quarter (500k credits) and then halved again (250k credits). It is no longer worth it to farm Devastator over other money making methods with the latest loot nerf unless you can achieve maximum efficiency by bringing Super Capital alts.
