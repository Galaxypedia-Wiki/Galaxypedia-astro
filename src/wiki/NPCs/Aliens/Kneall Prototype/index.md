_This article describes the former NPC Boss ship. For the Player-owned vessel with an almost identical appearance, see [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2)_

The **_Kneall Prototype_** is an [**Alien**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations) AI ship and is part of the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) Fleet.

## Description

The **Kneall Prototype** is a Kneall fleet ship added in the recent Alien AI update, along with a few others (like the [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Bruiser) and [Outrider]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Outrider)).

## Behavior

Unlike other Kneall [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), the **Kneall Prototype**will maneuver to a range of 0-500 studs away from its target. It is able to fight more effectively with this closer range allowing it to usually turn its side to the enemy.  

## Strategy

- Use a [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) or a similar [Frigate]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) to distract the [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) while Dreadnoughts and Battleships dish out heavy damage.
- Warp to a distance after destroying this ship, as it has a very large and damaging death explosion.

## Loot

- ? Alien Parts + 50 Plasma Batteries.
- You can only loot up to 25 plasma batteries per run from a Kneall Prototype wreck.

## Trivia

- The ship has a similar model to the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) but it is slightly different with numerous antennas and being smaller.
- Some people describe this as a weaker Prototype X-2 but, in fact, the **Kneall Prototype**'s DPS is much higherthan Prototype X-2's DPS.
- The Kneall Subcannon has poor LoS.
- You used to be able to pilot this in [Galaxy Development]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Development).
- Only rcouret is able to spawn it along with the Kneall Fleet in Galaxy.
