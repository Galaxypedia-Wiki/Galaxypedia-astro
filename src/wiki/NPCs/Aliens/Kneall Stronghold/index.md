## Description

The **Kneall Starbase** (also known as the **Stronghold**) is the equivalent of an **Alien Starbase**, from which waves of aliens spawn. Currently, this event will appear once in each server, when there is only one team left in Endgame.

Take extreme caution when approaching the **Kneall Starbase,** its armament consists of both copious laser, and railgun weaponry, giving the **Stronghold** its balanced and devastating firepower. Additionally, due to the turret's rapid fire, accuracy and range, they are also extremely effective against smaller ships. The strength of the base, combined with the large waves of aliens that support it, are capable of easily shredding even Super Capital ships, so caution is advised.

When it does spawn, a message from U.N.E. Supreme Commander Sean is relayed server-wide, and players can use a computer in [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) to join the fight. (Seen below)

## Strategy

The maximum [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields)/[Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) of the stronghold is 2.5M/1.5M, making the **Kneall Stronghold** one of the tankiest targets in the game.

Due to its range of about 8.5k and then adding also the size of the object itself, even [Siege]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging) ships may have some problems taking down a **Kneall Stronghold**.

A [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion) at the maximum distance to use its Commanding Presence module is able to prevent the Stronghold from shooting anyone else, while simultaneously healing faster than the base damages it. If a [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion) is present try lead hulled [Eradicators]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Eradicator) away from the [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion) so it can continue using its Commanding Presence module without warping away from the powerful Nuke and reseting the cooldown.

When using powerful ships such as the [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia) stop shooting at the stronghold around wave 4-5 as you may end up stealing other players %. This does not mean you can't participate in between waves.

## Loot

The Kneall Stronghold requires the player to deal 4.5% of the total damage (180,000) in order for the chance to receive one of the following items:

- [Disruptor Thrust Systems]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Disruptor-thrust-systems) (45%)

<!-- -->

- [Punisher Weapon Salvage]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher-Weapon-Salvage) (26%)

<!-- -->

- [Obliterator Shield Systems]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator-Shield-Systems) (16%),

<!-- -->

- [Annihilator Fighter Bay]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Annihilator-Fighter-Bay) (9%)

<!-- -->

- [Depleted Kneall Munitions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Depleted-Kneall-Munitions) (4%)

These can be sold or converted at the top of the Terminal D in [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

The stronghold can also be looted the regular way, although this can only happen if you're team is granted loot priority (The last shot on the stronghold) The wreck of the Kneall Stronghold also provides multiple [Kneall Cores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Core) and a very high amount of [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) and resources.

## Trivia

- The update was announced through a lore update rather than through the main update log in the Galaxy Discord Server.
- During the [Christmas 2020 event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}christmas-event-2020), it was re-introduced but renamed to Santa's Stronghold and had a red color scheme in replacement of the Kneall's green colors.
- The **Kneall** **Stronghold** is technically a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) , but players cannot dock at it.

- ![Message for when the stronghold spawns
in](Message.png "Message for when the stronghold spawns in")The **Kneall** **Stronghold** has its own economy hence being a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
