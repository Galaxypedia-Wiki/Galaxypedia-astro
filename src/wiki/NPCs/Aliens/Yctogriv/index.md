## Description

The **Yctogriv** is a small, speedy stealth ship with no weapons and a detection range of 5000. This ship is classed as a Miner. ![An Alien
Yctogriv, taken from
behind.](<Alien_Ycto_1_(by_rockpop2011).png> "An Alien Yctogriv, taken from behind.") ![Another Yctogriv, taken from up
close.](<Alien_Ycto_2_(by_rockpop2011).png> "Another Yctogriv, taken from up close.")

## Appearance

It's a small, flat ship with a smaller size than a [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer), with some exterior detailing.

## Strategy

- Use a strong anti AA ship such as the [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest).
- The warp effect can still be seen, so if you see a ship warping that doesn't appear on the minimap, you've likely located it.
- It can be called to fight by other [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) ships, so if you see a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) or [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) attack something, it won't be far behind.

## Loot

The Yctogriv drops one Scout Component and has no combat reward.

## Trivia

â€¢ Using the /info or /cost command on an Alien Yctogriv, it will come up with a box titled "Scrambled" and some text reading, "The data about that object seems to be encrypted."
