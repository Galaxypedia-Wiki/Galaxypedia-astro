The **_Outrider_** is an [**Alien**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations)AI ship with an array of turret and spinal-based weaponry.

## Description

The **Outrider** is an enemy AI ship that was first added as part of the Kneall fleet added in the Alien AI update, along with a few others (like the [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Bruiser) and [Scout]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Scout)). It is the [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) equivalent of a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:cruiser).

## Behavior

**Outriders** behave almost the same as [Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer). They tend to stay around 3 to 3.5k studs from whatever they are attacking and may move below [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) to maintain turret line of sight.

When the Kneall Fleet is spawned, **Outriders** are spawned with it. They will always answer a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher)'s call for help once spawned. They will scatter once the target they have been called to is destroyed.

Just like all other [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), swarms of **Outriders** are easily able to destroy Starbases, even the most defended. They are not to be underestimated in a 1 versus 1 fight, as they can destroy the strongest cruisers, and even some weak Battlecruisers. Do not underestimate their insane weapon range compared to similarly classed player ships.

## Strategy

Due to having cruiser size, they are best fought off using [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) with high accuracy turrets.

Their size also allows players to try and brute force the kill with a battlecruiser or battleship, as high accuracy weapons aren't necessary.

## Loot

Outrider wrecks give 50 Alien Parts.

## Version History

- Renamed from **Kneall Outrider** to **Outrider** in version .69d2

## Trivia

- Images of this ship could be found months before the update in the [Discord](https://discord.robloxgalaxy.wiki/%7CGalaxy)'s ship building hangar, and much earlier on the Mega Base's monitors for news broadcasts.
- You can see the remains of a crashed Kneall outrider near the remains of U.N.E. Base 12.
- The Outrider looks like the Specter from Galaxy on Fire 2.
- There can only be 5 Outriders spawned in a server at any time.
