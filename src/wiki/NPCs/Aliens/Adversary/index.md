The **_Adversary_** is an [Avellian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian) AI Boss dreadnought that served as the main boss of the [Christmas Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021).

## Description

The **\*Adversary**'' was the main boss (excluding the [Avellian Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian-Stronghold)) of the [Christmas Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021). Like the rest of the [Avellian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian) fleet, it shares some design traits and armament with them, however the**\*Adversary**'' has a unique vertical design, similar to the [Halkaryak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halkaryak). It is also the only [Avellian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian) ship (along with its playable counterpart, the [Khapri]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Khapri)) to be a shield-breaker instead of a hull-shredder.

## Behavior

The **\*Adversary**'' spawned roughly two hours into a round, with no player requirement. When spawned, it was announced at the top of the screen like other bosses. Upon being attacked, the**\*Adversary**'' called all other alien ships to its location. During battle, it tended to hover in place, being able to shoot its enemy from all angles using its superior line-of-sight.

## Strategy

- Although the **_Adversary_** has forward-facing weaponry, its turrets can rotate to fire behind and to the sides of it as well. Because of this, the ship has no effective blindspot, so attempting to abuse this strategy proves fatal.
- Gather a fleet of hull tanks in order to shrug off the blasts of the **\*Adversary**'', however take caution to not be destroyed by the hull-shredding armament of the**\*Adversary's**'' fleet: bring some strong AA ships such as the [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest) to pick off the smaller ships.
- The most popular strategy for killing the **_Adversary_** was simply to draw it to a high-level [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) with a fast ship and draw the fleet's fire while the base destroyed them.

## Loot

- Drops 80 Snowflakes, 6 Plasma Batteries and 135 Alien Parts.

## Trivia

- Considered to be the easiest event boss due to its measly health and damage when compared to other event bosses such as the [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) or [Hellkeeper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hellkeeper).
- Briefly used the model of the [Mantid]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mantid) before it was changed to the [Khapri]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Khapri) because "Mantid doesn't really look like a boss".
  - It can be assumed **_Adversary_**'s loadout was that of the [Mantid's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mantid) during this period.
