![centre|thumb|432x432px|Flag of the
Avellians](AVELLIANFLAG.png "centre|thumb|432x432px|Flag of the Avellians") The Avellians are an alien race from the same species as the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) and [Slarfie]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slarfie) but are a **Rogue**, split off from the 2 Mentioned Factions and are hostile to any Factions that isn't Avellian. They possess advanced technologies and powerful ships.

Like the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall), they are a vicious, warlike alien race that seeks to destroy every life, including the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall), and played a major role in the [Christmas Event 2021]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2021), with [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) Ships being replaced by their own ships like the [Shadowstrike]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shadowstrike) or [Adversary]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Adversary).

# Ships

Avellians have made numerous powerful ships, listing; The [Flea]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Flea), The [Solstice]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Solstice), The [Shadowmane]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shadowmane), The [Mantid]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mantid), and the [Khapri]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Khapri), and had a dedicated [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases), The [Avellian Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian-Stronghold).

Avellian ships have a shadow and ghostly appearance.

"[Almost] nothing was spared, nothing even remained except masses of molten slag and wreckage, and an overwhelming feeling of dread.

This was only reinforced by the sole piece of intact technology we managed to recover; The <span style="color:#b708ff">logs</span> of an unrecognisable Kneall ship.... or structure.

[EXCERPT FROM COMMANDER **Ivan Brish**.]

[...]

[The UNE-SDDS Perseverance was ingrained into its own bubble of silent stillness. The working day approached its end, but inside the station was still alive with movement and activity. The UNE would not be allowed a break, even at Christmas. I knew this best; a man sterner for the hundreds of sleepless nights i'd spent guiding attacks and analysing data. The silent night passed, with Brish at the helm of the station's operation. With all of the constant analysis and maintenance, nothing exterior to ordinary operation occurred.]

[Until (In Earth Time) the dawn of Christmas Day approached. As many retired to take a short break and to contact their families, a sudden burst of readings was received. Fermian scanners were receiving spikes in energy. Not radio energy from distant signals, but warp signatures.

[PLAYING TRANSCRIPT 1 OF LOG #7]

_"Proximity Alarms can be heard blaring"_

"Kneall?"

"It wouldn't seem so, sir."

"Then what?"

"Slarfie, sir.?"

_Ivan Brish can be heard murmuring:_

"Potential Diplomats,"

_Then Commanded_

"Send a response fleet, make them well armed, but tell them only to shoot by my orders."

[There's something so.... off about this technology.]

[Compared to the Kneall, it's so simplistic - so easily replicated. Where Kneall technology takes months, maybe years of development and research to understand, this branch of the slarfie (these so-called Avellians) builds in a very simple manner.]

[It's powerful, and that cannot be denied, but its workings are so obvious and easily replicated that it remains enigmatic to us just how these things have managed to kickstart a crusade across the galaxy, obliterating all in their path!]

[Aside from that, it's also strange that, while their ships are powerful, they cannot match the same technology in the hands of the Avellians. Even a ship which is a one-to-one perfect recreation will lose to an Avellian nine times out of ten.]

[It isn't strategy; they've proven that their strategic knowhow is limited with their simplistic swarm-and-overwhelm techniques.]

[It's almost like this technology reacts differently to their kind.]

[This idea should be inspected further.]
