_This article describes an NPC ship. For the player ship with the same appearance and without any turret, see [Preos Egg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Preos-Egg)._

The **Plagued Preos Egg** is an [Alien AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) added during the **[2021 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).**

## Description

An egg-shaped ship with phasers that spawns every 45 minutes in a server and only needs one player to spawn.

## Behavior

- Summons all aliens on the server when attacked.
- Cannot be lured, as it does not give chase to players.
- Can not warp.
- Spawns every 45 min.

## Loot

- 45 Preos Bits
- 1 Embryo (rarely 2 embryos)

## Strategy

- Destroy all other aliens before attacking the egg, as a fleet of hatchlings and juveniles can do massive damage.
- Use Wasps to attack the _Plagued Preos Egg_ and get the Hatchlings and Juveniles to focus on you, then warp to a high-level [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and let it kill the Hatchlings and Juveniles. Once the Egg is alone or has little Hatchlings on the map, spawn a ship to kill the Egg.

## Version History

- Spawn time reduced from 90 minutes to 45 minutes, amount of Preos Bits increased from 45 to 10, amount of Embryos reduced from 2 to 1, gained the ability to drop 2 Embryos instead of 1 in version .74b4.
