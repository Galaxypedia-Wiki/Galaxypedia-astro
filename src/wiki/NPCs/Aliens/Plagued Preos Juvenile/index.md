The **_Plagued Preos Juvenile_** is an Alien ship added during the [2021 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).

## Description

The **Plagued Preos Juvenile** is similar to the [Plagued Preos Hatchling]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Preos-Hatchling), but has a somewhat larger and more complex model. It is also more well-armed and drops better loot.

## Behavior

â€¢ The Juvenile appears to use an advanced version of the AI seen in regular Kneall and Pirate ships. It will attempt to stay 2-3k away from the player, similar to the Hatchling

## Loot

- 6-10 Preos Bits

## Strategy

- Similar strategies to killing the Juvenile as with the [Hatchling]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plagued-Preos-Hatchling)
- Use of a dreadnought is recommended to kill the Juvenile, but a skilled player may be able to solo it with a battleship
- It's health is mainly composed of hull points so get a ship with dps slightly into hull shredding over shield.
