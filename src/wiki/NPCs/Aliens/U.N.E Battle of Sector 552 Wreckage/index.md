# Battle of Sector 552

The Battle of Sector 552 occurred in a designated part of the galaxy formerly held by the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall). It occurred during the period when second-generation warships were in widespread use. ![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Battle-wrecks.PNG-"Battle-wrecks.PNG"){width="650"} The battle started when Kneall forces launched a surprise attack on an undisclosed fleet near Sector 552. This sector's designation now puts it in the bottom right corner of most current [maps]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) of the galaxy. Task Force 784, an elite group of commanders commissioned by the [United Nations of Earth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}United-Nations-of-Earth) Fleet, were present during the battle. While the total number of lives lost on either side remains confidential, most historians place estimates well into the thousands.

**Victors: United Nations of Earth (Decisive)** **Losers: Kneall** **Total ships lost:** Unknown; The mangled remains of 2 United Nations of Earth Fleet Dreadnoughts and at least 5 Punisher-class Kneall warships can still be found in Sector 552.![centre|thumb|400x400px|The location of the wreckage.
