## Description

**_Aliens_** are one of the only two enemy AI Factions in the game, the other being the [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates). Any ships affiliated with the Alien faction will attack any ship or [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases)/[Planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) that is not their same faction on sight, at a minimum of 15,000 studs away from them. They can also attack the enemy AI faction [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates)

All of the alien ships currently in the game are made and used by the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall), but during the past events, other alien factions, such as the [Avellian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avellian), temporarily replaced the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall).

## Alien Fleet

The Alien ships that currently spawn naturally are the following: The Alien ships that currently don't spawn naturally are the following:

- Small alien ships spawn in groups of 3-5 at random locations on the map.
- Large alien ships spawn alone at random locations on the map.
- Recent updates have limited the number of **Alien** ships that can spawn in one server to 20, but they can still build up considerable groups with enough firepower to destroy even the strongest [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- Alien ships that are [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships)-class or larger have the ability to call all aliens currently in the map to their aid, and can target [Starbases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) and [Planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets)
- All Alien ships can spawn in Private Servers.

## Ship Stats

Aliens tend to focus on shield damage, with the exception of the [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator).

Note: All alien ships, from [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer), all the way to the [Kneall Prototype]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Prototype) have a fixed damage resistance of 30%, regardless of ship class.

## Planet Capturing

[Punishers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) and [Decimators]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) can command alien fleets to capture and assimilate [Planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) just like player factions, and can cause a server shutdown if it targets (and destroys) [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). Although other aliens don't target the planet when they come to close proximity, when the mentioned ships calls the aliens on the map to assist them to attack a planet, they will.

Once a Planet is captured, it will have a bright green color in the Map along with the current territory it's occupied with. Aliens targeting the planet when it was captured may linger at planets after taking control instead of warping away, making it difficult to retake the planet.

If the planet is heavily defended by **Aliens** and/or upgraded, a single [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) may not be enough to take it back. It may take more than one faction's limit of Dreadnoughts and multiple sieges to take back a heavily defended Planet taken by a spawned Kneall Fleet.

You can also use a captured planet to your advantage by using it as a lure making it easier for Aliens to come to you, _(Keep in mind that you must only have a maximum of a Level 1 Planet in order to do this.)_

## Version History

Version .65b saw the introduction of four new Alien ships; the [Outrider]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Outrider), [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Bruiser), [Scout]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Scout), and [Kneall Prototype]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Prototype), said to be a weaker [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2). These ships, along with the original two aliens ([Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) and [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher)) were able to be spawned at Myriad when fully upgraded.

Version .67c Gave the [Bruiser]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bruiser), the [Outrider]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Outrider) and the Kneall Scout can now spawn in the map.

Version .69b saw the [Halloween 2020 Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2020), The Aliens were changed for the duration of the event to [Servs]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Serv), [Scourges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Scourge), and much more. Once the event ended, the [Scout]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Scout) was permanently removed from the game. Previously, the ships had the word "Kneall" in front of them, making their full name "Alien Kneall Bruiser." The Outrider and Bruiser were recently changed to just say "Alien Bruiser," marking their faction and their ship name.

Version .69e saw the introduction of the Alien ship, the [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator). This ship spawns after a certain amount of time has passed. It has the highest amount of health out of all aliens that can spawn in the game, making it a formidable enemy. It can also call other aliens to its aid, like the Punisher. The [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement)'s build menu description mentioned it over a year ago, but it was only recently added. It's power is comparable to a [Rift Guardian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rift-Guardian).

Version .75a10 saw the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event), Which introduced alien starbases such as the [Devastator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Devastator) and the Kneall Outpost which they will be removed for the conclusion of the event. This event also introduced the [Kneall Bionicle]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Bionicle) which was an identical counterpart to the player-ownable [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships). These new alien enemies were around until the conclusion of the [Kneall Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Event).

Version .75a27 increased [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher)'s spawn limit to 2.

Version .75a37 made [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) pacifistic against [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) _(Unless targeted by [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher))_ and no longer spawns on top of [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

## Trivia

- Most Alien ships have a purple trail.
- It is possible for **Aliens** to assimilate a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- **Aliens** and [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) will fight each other.
- Interestingly, the [MRLS Launcher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MRLS-Launcher)'s engines resemble that of Alien ships.
- A full alien swarm should not be underestimated, A [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher), [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) and all the other Alien ships can even force a [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer) to retreat.
- Since the gatling update, all aliens have gatling Turrets, making the server quite laggy during swarm.
- The [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) is the only alien ship with a different icon color than all other non-event aliens.
- The Decimator does not have its faction name in its name, making it seen as "Decimator" in game.
