## Description

The **Alien Harvest Servitor** is a mini-boss ship added during the [2018 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018). It was similar in size to the [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), but was more powerful on its own. It cannot call other Aliens like the Punisher can, making it a viable strategy to solo these ships for their loot. They would spawn alone or alongside the [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King). **Servitors** are recognized by their orange, punisher-sized symbol on the minimap. **Servitors** dropped two [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) upon destruction, as well as various ores.

## Armament

The **Servitor** was equipped with six [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). They were also equipped with around 3 Medium Cannons. This combination made them incredibly deadly against even the most balanced ships, especially bigger ships that the low-accuracy Turrets could easily hit.

## Strategy

Distractions with small, fast ships like the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) and [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco) were effective ways to draw or avoid **Servitors**' fire. Despite the laser's extreme rate of fire, the accuracy of all [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) on the **Servitor** is nothing compared to the speed of a Viper or Draco. Even being as close as 2000-3000 studs away poses little danger to well-piloted [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates).

Outside of using a simple and easy distraction ship, players may try to brute force the kill. Unfortunately, aside from [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts), not many ships could withstand the _full fire_ of a **Servitor** without having to retreat and heal. They could also use a Spinal-based ship to attack the servitor from a distance, the spinal based ship would constantly drift and fire while hoping not to get hit too many times. This strategy was best used with a [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing).

## Version History

- Seat reversed in an unknown version. (it was backwards upon release, allowing it to use Spinals while moving away from the player)
