The **_Bruiser_** is an [**Alien**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations) [AI]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) ship roughly equivalent to a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).

## Description

The **Bruiser** is an Alien AI ship first added as a part of the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) fleet in the Alien AI update, along with a few others like the [Outrider]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Outrider) and [Scout]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Scout). It is the [Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) equivalent of a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).

## Behavior

It will stay 500--1000 away from its target, turning around at the maximum distance and heading back towards the target ship. This is oddly close for an [**Alien**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations), as it makes it an easy target to hit with [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals) and [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets).

## Strategy

- Its health is primarily [shield-based]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), so shield-breaking ships with laser turrets or phaser spinals are particularly effective.
- Watch out for its spinals, as it can fire them backwards.
- If using a small ship try to get above it so its spinals and turrets cannot hit you.
- You can also use an AA/[Support]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}support-ships) ship to easily defeat it.

## Loot

- Bruiser wrecks give 120 Alien Parts and 1 [Bruiser Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bruiser-Part).

## Trivia

- A crashed bruiser can be seen on Myriad.
- Before the update of .67c the alien bruiser could only be spawned with a quest at Frion's Lucifer Station. Now it spawns naturally along with other Alien enemy ships like the Outrider.
- Only 3 Bruisers can be spawned in a server at any time.
- One of the only ships to have intentionally backwards-firing spinals.
