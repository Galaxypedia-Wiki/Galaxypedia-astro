The **_Rift Guardian_** is a unique [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships)Â ship that appeared in the [Halloween 2020]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2020) event. It is the weaker version of the [Rift Custodian]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rift-Custodian).

## Description

The **Rift Guardian** is an AI ship which model, [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) look very similar to [Abaddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abaddon) and [Azreal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Azreal), and has the exact same ambient sound.

2 of these and a single Rift Custodian would normally spawn within 60 minute intervals, although it used to spawn within 120 minute intervals, and used to also spawn immediately when the round started.

## Strategy

### Use a Starbase

Lure it towards a Level 5 Starbase through an [Alien Serv]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Serv) or [Alien Sourge]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Scourge) call and then bring out a high DPS Dreadnought or Battleship from another base, warp over to that Level 5 Starbase, and attack it while the starbase attacks it as well. Attack the rear of the ship, since that is the blindspot for most of its turrets, while the starbase dishes out high damage, making it an easy kill.

### Use two Starbases

A more risky but cost efficient way is to simply build two Level 2 Starbases and immediately lure it before alien numbers multiply.

### Bait

Another way is to have an alt with you or an friend in a server with a Wyrm/Wasp to go into the Rift so it'll make the NPCs focus it. From there, you go with a high shield DPS ship and just shoot the Rift aliens until they die. After that, quickly loot the wrecks, as the Aliens can respawn while you're looting and kill you in a near-instant.

Inside the rift, spinals are mostly unusable. Rift Guardians and [Rift Custodians]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rift-Custodian) are shield tanks, so you need ships with high turret-based shield DPS. The best ship in the game for this is the [Jupiter]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jupiter).
