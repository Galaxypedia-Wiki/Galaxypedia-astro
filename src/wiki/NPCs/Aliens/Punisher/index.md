The **_Punisher_** (Also known as **Alien Punisher** or **Kneall Punisher**) is an AI **[Alien]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens)Â **ship made and used by the [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall).

## Description

The **Punisher** fits between the player ship classifications of [Battleship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). It has considerable health and firepower and is almost never seen alone. It poses a significant threat to battleships or below, even most dreadnoughts if the supporting fleet is large enough, however, [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), even level ones can kill it and its escorts. It is mostly black with a few areas highlighted in neon green.

## Behavior

Much like the [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer), **Punishers** will maneuver to a range of 3K to 5K studs away from their targets and will move back and forth along that range. They may also attempt to out speed attacking ships to stay out of player [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) range. Additionally, **Punishers** initiating an attack will **"call"** all other [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) in the server to their location, in which other aliens will stop whatever they are doing, and warp to the Punisher's location, having the potential to create incredibly powerful and dangerous fleets capable of taking down even starbases. The only warning to these gatherings is a small period of time in which all Alien ships will \*turn towards the attacking **Punisher\***, which can be seen on the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap). If the Punisher's target attempts to flee, regardless of health, the Punisher (and any other aliens) will give chase. Following the appearance of [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator), the Punisher can also "**call**" the entire fleet around the map to destroy player's starship or Starbase.

## Strategy

Despite their rather low chance of spawning, **Punishers** are not that rare a sight. Attack these with caution; use either a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) or a fleet of [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and/or [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers). It is also helpful to lure **Punishers** closer to armed bases to deal even more damage. Skilled players have been able to solo them without [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) help using [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships). Some extremely skilled players can solo them without the help of [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) firepower in only a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) or [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers). Be sure to take out other aliens other than the Punisher so that when it calls for reinforcements, it will not be able to receive any backup because they were destroyed. Prioritize taking out Punisher before other reinforcements arrive as the Punisher will often act as a Command Ship. If the player is outnumbered and outgunned, practically when there is a Decimator and far outside the Starbase, escape is the first priority and do not let the Punisher give chase.

If you want to upgrade your level one starbase really quick, or just get your base some credits, then take out a frigate, cruiser, or any small ship than can dodge the **Punisher's** shots easily. Ideally you would choose a frigate. An [Avenger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avenger) is recommended because of its turrets and speed, or you can use the cheaper option, the [Raven]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Raven). All small ships get the job done though, and you will very likely have the same exact results despite your choice of ship. Warp to the **Punisher**, then shoot the **Punisher** until it starts shooting back at you, then warp to your starbase. The **Punisher** should follow you, if it does not, then keep trying until it does. Once the **Punisher** takes the bait and follows you to your starbase, let the starbase kill it while you despawn your ship. The starbase should deal with it easily. The combat reward that the starbase gets from killing it is good enough to upgrade your base to level 2 or 3 depending on how many reinforcements it has. After it dies, you can also loot the Plasma Batteries it drops, a very valuable drop that can be exchanged for Uranium.

## Loot

**Punishers** currently drop 100 Alien Parts and 3 Plasma Batteries.

## Trivia

- Has an explosion value of 65
- The **Punisher** got a remodel in version .65a6.
- The first **Punisher** model was larger than some [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Has a purple trail.
- If you fly close to a punisher, you can hear it humming. The siren is an alarm from Alien: Isolation.
- When primary focused on an attack it tries to get away to one of the borders without warping to escape. This mostly happens when soloing a punisher in a dreadnought or a battleship.
- Like the [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer), the Punisher received a Halloween remodel for the 2019 Halloween Event, known as "Punisher Pie", and receiving a brown Punisher icon, eventually being removed for lag issues.
- At the same time, in the Halloween upgrade, the Punisher got a loot buff adding an extra 500 Uranium to the drop when killed, eventually being increased to 750 Uranium, making alien hunting extremely profitable.
- A crashed punisher can be seen on [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad), another being visible on [Pyramus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pyramus), although using a previous model.
- The punisher was temporarily replaced by the [Alien Scourge]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Scourge) in .69b5
- The punisher third railgun was removed in an unknown version, it was the only ship for the longest time to have 10 turrets.
- The punisher also had a blue nametag at the 4th of July event.
- In version .73c8(?), the [Medium Alien Railgun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) turrets were significantly nerfed; they lost their Alien classification and were defaulted to standard medium railguns. This caused the **Punisher** and the [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator) to become laughably weak ships compared to what they were before.
- Old photos can be seen here:
- When using the ":cost" command, as with other alien ships, the text is "No one around here knows how to build one of those".
- Pirates have been observed chasing aliens that were called to a calling alien ship's location.
