## Description

The [Festive Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Kodiak) was a boss used for the [Christmas Event 2023]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2023).

## Appearance

Based on the same model as the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) but significantly upscaled, the Festive Kodiak dwarfs the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator) and features a white coating instead of yellow. Despite its increased size, its movement remains unimpeded by its massive bulk, allowing it to match speeds with the [Paragon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Paragon) and other agile ships. ![In-game
