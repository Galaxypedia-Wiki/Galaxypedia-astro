The **Judgement Prime** is a special type of AI enemy ship which does not spawn naturally. It is based off the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement).

## Summary

The **Judgement Prime** is an extremely dangerous ship; not only does it have ridiculously high durability, its extremely powerful armament is enough to quickly destroy any ship unfortunate enough to be caught within its crosshairs. It is best to fight this enemy with a very large fleet, utilizing some smaller ships as sacrificial distractions to minimize losses.
