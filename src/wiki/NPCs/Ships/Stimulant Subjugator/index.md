The **Stimulant Subjugator** is an [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Titan]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}titans) that spawned during the duration of the [Ultimate Retro Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ultimate-Retro-Event-2022).

## Description

The Stimulant Subjugator is an [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) Retro variant of the [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator) that is classified as a [Titan]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}titans) instead of a [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships). ![The Stimulant

## Behavior

It follows the same pattern as most [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) ships.

Its spawns every 180 minutes and only does so on Public servers.

## Strategy

The Stimulant Subjugator is an extremely powerful and dangerous [Boss]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}bosses), since it only spawns on public servers, call for support from other players to take it down.

Despite its incredibly intimidating HP and DPS, Stimulant Subjugator is actually laughably easy to defeat if you have a coordinated team of experienced players. Here are a few strategies that clans may use to easily destroy Stimulant Subjugator without the help of bases:

**IMPORTANT**, it is very recommended that you destroy Stimulant Andromeda before engaging Stimulant Subjugator.

**Method 1: Kiting**

Recommended ships for kiter: Retro Cyclops, Astraeus. If you cannot afford either, use a Judgement.

The kiter warps in first, staying at 12k from Stimulant Subjugator. Take the aggro of the Stimulant Subjugator and turn away. Go away at max throttle and wait for Stimulant Subjugator to get within 8k range. Once Stimulant Subjugator is within 8k range, the rest of the people should warp to 4k-6k away from Stimulant Subjugator. **It is very important that you do not get closer than 4k, otherwise the kiter will lose aggro. It is also important for the kiter to use their ship's long ranged turrets to shoot the Stimulant Subjugator whenever in range to keep aggro priority.** The kiter should start a short warp to 10k away from Stimulant Subjugator when they get within 7.5k from Stimulant Subjugator. The DPS crew are to eliminate enemies in this order: Tempest -> Centurion -> Grievion -> Nyx. Once all other stimulant ships are dead, the DPS group is to target the Stimulant Subjugator. The kiter should keep kiting until Stimulant Subjugator dies.

## Loot

The Stimulant Subjugator drops no loot but instead gives out 500k+ in combat rewards.

## Trivia

- The old [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator) model it uses looks similar to a blimp.
- One of the only 2 [AI]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI) ships to carry [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters), the other being the [Pirate Waspinator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirate-Waspinator).
