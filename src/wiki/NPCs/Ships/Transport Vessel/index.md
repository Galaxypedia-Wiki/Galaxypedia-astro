## Description

The **_Transport Vessel_** is part of a new update which allows players to create [Outposts]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Outposts) if they meet the criteria. It has the same model as the [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class) and same interior.

## Appearance

The Transport Vessel appears exactly the same as the freighter **E Class** does, both on the exterior and in the interior.

## Outpost Making

![A Transport Vessel making an
outpost](Video2.mp4 "A Transport Vessel making an outpost") Making an outpost can only be done by the team leader. They must first select a base, then they can choose a spot for the new outpost. The outpost cannot be further than ~100k from the selected base, and cannot be within ~13k of any base, including planets and the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). Once a base and valid location have been selected, if that base has 25k Silicate, 5k Carbon, 4K (?) Iridium, and 1k Uranium, a _Transport Vessel_ will spawn on that base/planet, and turn towards it's final location and slowly lumber on its own to the spot wanted. Once the spot is met, it will start spinning around with a shield around it, and eventually make another an Outpost.

## Trivia

- On 3/19/23, a dev accidently released Transport Vessels to the Build Menu for free, allowing players to obtain the ship.

## The Outpost Glitch of 3/21/23
