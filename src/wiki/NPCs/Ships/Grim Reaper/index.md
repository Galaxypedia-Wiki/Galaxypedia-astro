The **_Grim Reaper_** was an [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) boss from the [Halloween Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017).

## Description

The **Grim Reaper** was an AI similar to [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) and [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), except it was even stronger than some Dreadnoughts at the time. You had to destroy the **Grim Reaper** multiple times and collect Pumpkins for the [Halloween Quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Quest). It could have dropped up to 4 at a time. The **Grim Reaper** is the equivalent of a [Level 3 Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase). The **Grim Reaper** had an icon similar to an [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) except it was orange and a lot bigger. The **Grim Reaper** has total 18k health, [12 Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), [1 Huge Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals), and several Plasma Turrets. The **Grim Reaper** is able to solo a [Level 3 Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase). The **Grim Reaper** only spawned once per round and the server must have had at least 5 players in it for it to spawn.

## Strategy

Stay mobile and don't let it outsmart you, however, also try to land as many [Spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) hits as you can. If you are fighting in a group, it's best to take different [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), such as the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker) to tank and dish out damage, a fast dread like the [Slipstream]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slipstream), to distract the [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and a few [Leviathans]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Leviathan) or [Nemesises]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nemesis) to deal a lot of extra damage. If you had a large team, a powerful Carrier could have done the job.

The **Grim Reaper** may be removed but is still in the game files and [Rcouret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rcouret) can spawn it anytime he likes. ![The Grim
