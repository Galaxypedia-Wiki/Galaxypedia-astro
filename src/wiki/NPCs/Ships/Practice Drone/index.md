The **_Practice Drone_** is an [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) drone that can be spawned in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

## Description

The **Practice Drone** is an AI ship that can only be spawned if [Rcouret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rcouret) chooses to spawn it. The drone is fast and will fly around in the interior of the Mega Base much like an [Alien Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) would, but instead the practice drone is unarmed. It is likely that it does not and will not serve any purpose in gameplay.
