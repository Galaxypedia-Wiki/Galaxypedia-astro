The **_Hellkeeper_** is a Pirate [**AI**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) Boss added during the [2021 Halloween Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}halloween-2021).

## Description

The **Hellkeeper** is a pirate [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) boss with dark red, black, and glowing orange coloring. Its model has various horns, ribs, and other sharp, curved features. Its various turrets float as translucent red orbs above each turret pad and are largely top-mounted, allowing players to fly small ships underneath the **Hellkeeper** while remaining out of its line of fire.

## Behavior

The **Hellkeeper** is similar to the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) in that it can call [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) ships to its side for reinforcements and will chase the player. If the **Hellkeeper** isn't chasing the player _(which happens often)_, then the [Dissonances]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dissonance) will. It will attack ANYTHING except [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and other [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates).

## Loot

- 200 Souls _(Takes up 20k cubic meters of cargo space, which will require 2 runs with an [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class) to fully loot the Hellkeeper's wreck)_

## Strategy

- **DO NOT TAKE THIS ON ALONE** _UNLESS_ YOU LURE IT TO A BASE OR USE A CARRIER.
- Make sure to destroy the [Pirate Dissonance]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dissonance) fleet before attacking the **Hellkeeper.**
- Lure it to a high-level [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or the [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership).
- Alternatively, use a carrier with high damage fighters _([Nyx]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nyx), [Rhino]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rhino), [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus), etc)_ if AI fighters are available or you have a large faction of players willing to listen to your orders.
- Use ships with high [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) health such as [Armageddon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armageddon) and [Blackgate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blackgate), because the **Hellkeeper** is a shield-breaking ship. _(Avoid the spinals for less [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage)_
- The **Hellkeeper** has a huge blind spot right below it. Try to stay in that spot as much as you can, just be aware of the speed of it.
