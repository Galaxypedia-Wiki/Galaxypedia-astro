The **_X-7849_** is an **[AI]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npc-ships) [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)**

## Description

The **X-7849** is an AI ship that, although classed on the map and via commands as a Battlecruiser, is, in fact, a special [E Class]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}E-Class) freighter carrying artifacts. It is an exact copy AI of the [X-0]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}X-0) aside from dropping different loot.

## Loot

- 2 Data Archives

## Strategy

- This ship is undefended on its own, but can call pirates to its side for reinforcement.
- Can be lured to a max level [starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}starbase), but it will require the help of tanking and distracting to take it down, as a pirate fleet deals heavy damage with their spinals.

## Version History

- Removed from being able to spawn along with the [X-4756]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}X-4756), presumably for the duration of the [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios)' advanced ship rotation in version .72(?).
- Added back along few other X class ships after [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios)' advanced ship rotation during the [Atheon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Atheon) advanced ship rotation in version .7[?][?]
- Spawning for this ship currently disabled during Halloween event 2021 version .7[?][?]

## Trivia

- This ship appears to use the same AI as all other AI-class ships, as it will "engage" targets and move back and forth away and towards the target in a similar way to the Alien [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher).
- Has the Ability to call for backup. Any pirate ship in the map will warp to its location when attacked.
