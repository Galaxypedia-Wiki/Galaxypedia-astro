_This article is about the NPCs, not to be confused with [the Player's Behaviour.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating)_

## Description

Pirates are one of the only two enemy AI Factions in the game, the other being the [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens). Any ships affiliated with the Pirate faction will attack any ships at a minimum of 15,000 studs away from them. Pirate ships will not attack [Planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets)/[Starbases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) whether the faction that owns it is on the enemy or not.

- Pirate ships show up with dark red color on the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap).
- Pirate ships are not affiliated with any official factions in the game and mostly use variants of Player owned ships.

## Pirate Fleet

The Pirate ships that currently spawn naturally are the following:

The Pirate ships that currently don't spawn naturally are the following:

</div>

- Small Pirate ships spawn in groups of 3 at random locations on the map.
- Capital pirate ships spawn alone at random locations.
- Pirate ships that are [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts)-class or larger have the ability to call all pirate currently in the map to their aid, with the exception of [X-0]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}X-0).
- The Strategies on how to beat them can be found in their respective ship pages.

## Ship Stats

Pirate Ships tend to have more hull health and focus on hull damage.

Note: All Pirate ships, from [Dragoon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragoon), all the way to the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak), follow their respective damage resistance in the Ship class they're in. _(e.g, Galleon has 50% Damage Resistance due to being a [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) class Ship.)_

As of this edit, the damage resistance of X-0 is bugged and it has the resistance of a Super Capital, which is 65%.

## Freedom Base Pirates

<span class="mw-customtoggle-myDivision"><u>**Click here to read about this.**</u></span>

<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" id="mw-customcollapsible-myDivision">

Originally, in Beta. Pirates only spawned at the Freedom Base when a player accepted the [Freedom Base Quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Star-Wars-Event) at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) when speaking to [Luca Sky]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Luca-Sky) (formerly [Luke Skybawler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Star-Wars-Event)). One pirate spawned per person who accepts the quest with a maximum of 9 pirates. They also used to spawn randomly at the [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base). Prior to the public release, there was no max amount of pirates, leading to swarms of pirates able to take down a fleet of Dreadnoughts. Pirate Avengers chased the player for up to 10K studs and did a lot more damage than normal [Avengers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avenger) do.

The Pirate [Osprey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osprey) was removed to make it a bit easier for players to kill the Pirates. The Pirate [Starblade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starblade) was also later removed for being too OP with backward firing torpedoes, aimbot, and ramming. This left only the Pirate [Avenger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avenger) as a possible pirate ship back then.

## Version History

- Version _???_ added a new Pirate Boss; The [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) spawned by during the "Dining in Hell" and "Depthbreaker" quest paths, and later spawned naturally.
- Version _???_ saw the Valentine's Day 2021, which spawned pirate ships; the Pirate [Heartbreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Heartbreaker), and Pirate [Hearteater]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hearteater).
- Version .72e4 saw the [Galaxy Fourth of July 2021]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fourth-of-july-2021) event, which spawned special pirate ships like the [Rogue Arctic Wasteland]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rogue-Arctic-Wasteland), [Rogue Weapon of Mass Destruction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rogue-Weapon-of-Mass-Destruction),
- Version .72f1 added a new Pirate Boss; The [Galleon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galleon).
- Version .75a9 saw the [April Fool's Event 2022]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2022), which temporarily replaced [Galleon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galleon)'s spawns with Pirate [Waspinators]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Waspinator).
- Version .75a11 enabled the spawns of a recent event ship, [yname]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}<Yname-(ship)> "wikilink"). These spawned in huge numbers and could call pirates once they have a target. These spawns were later disabled.

## Trivia

- Most Pirate ships are variants of their playable counterparts.
- [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), The [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) and [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) will fight each other.
- Admins can spawn extremely powerful Pirate Fleets in public servers, though this is met with some rules.
- Pirates do not seem to attack admin ships.
- The only AI Faction to use a [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) as part of their fleet.
- Avenger, along with [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement), are the only 2 ships that the NPC uses without an AI Variant.
- The [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) was a stolen ship that was originally made by the [Slarfie]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Slarfie).
- It is possible for **Pirates** to capture a [Planet]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets), by hiding behind or inside a planet, so while Pirates try to shoot you down, they hit the planet instead.
