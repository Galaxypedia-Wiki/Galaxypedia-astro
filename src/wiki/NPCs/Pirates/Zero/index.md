{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Zero_**is a very good [**Destroyer**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:destroyer) for dog-fighting.

## Description

The **Zero** has a decent amount of health, while also being fast and maneuvrable. It is very good for attacking larger ships from their blind-spots and killing fighters with its turrets and phasers. There are two gatling guns which can take on smaller ships. A very good starting warship.

## Interior

The interior of the **Zero** consists only of a small pass-through cockpit window and a square acting as the pilot's seat.

## Advantages

- Fourth cheapest [Destroyer]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers).
- Powerful phasers, they can all fire together.
- Good [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) damage.

## Disadvantages

- Weak hull.
- The [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) fire in a horizontal line, making hitting small ships and aiming difficult.
- Not as much DPS (damage per second) as the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra).
- Very weak turrets.
- It will get melted by a Cobra or any other ships with a lot of phasers.
- Rather slow for a [Destroyer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships).
- Low [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) damage.

## Strategy

- Use this ships agility to attack Frigates and Fighters.
- Send this ship out to destroy any attacking carriers fighters
- Avoid ships with many small turrets such as the ampharos as they will shred you apart.
- Use Q and E to tilt your ship to make sure the most spinals can hit.

## Version History

- Remodeled in an unknown version.
- Top speed reduced from 210 to 115, Turn Speed reduced from 0.63 to 0.5, 2 [Medium Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) changed to 4 [Small Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and given a remodel in version .66b.

## Trivia

- It docks the same way a [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) does where you can just walk straight into the ship.
- The Zero was for a brief time the only ship to have [Homing Missiles]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cancelled-Updates) on it, but only in [Galaxy Development]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Development).
- You can get the ship for free by using code "SPACE".
