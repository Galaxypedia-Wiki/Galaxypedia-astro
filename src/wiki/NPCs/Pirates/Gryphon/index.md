{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Gryphon_** is a [**Cruiser**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}:category:cruiser)with amazing mobility,suited for dog-fighting and pest control.

## Description

The **Gryphon** is a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) with 3 [Medium Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). It is equipped with very high mobility unseen by many other [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers). This ship has a very futuristic design and well-built engines.

## Appearance

The **Gryphon** has a large bay door that opens to the inside of the ship. The main bay contains 12 [faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions)-colored passenger chairs that players can sit in. The pilot's seat is rather small and in an elevated area compared to the rest of the seats.

The side ladder leads to the underside, with a small hallway leading to both ends of the ship. Between them, there is the interior, which has a bunk bed and a computer. There is a chair in front of the computer which you can sit in. Various images can be found on the monitor, and lots of notes can be found in or around the garbage bin next to it.

## Advantages 

- [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are strong against smaller or similarly sized [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).  
- High [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) accuracy and range.  
- Good health and mobility, a rare combo for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers). 
- Hard-counters most [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) ranging from [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates) to [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers). 
- Great damage output for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- Balanced damaged against both [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).

## Disadvantages 

- Very large for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).   
- Awkwardly placed [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) make it hard to hit smaller [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) up close.   
- Out-gunned by higher class [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships).
- Relies on spinals for shield damage.

## Strategy

- Gather a fleet of **Gryphons** and chase down fleeing [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ships) for easy kills.
- Don't engage in a head-to-head fight with [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) and up, instead strafe around them or fight in numbers.
- Use your agility to attack [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates), [Destroyers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}destroyers) and other [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) using your [Medium Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to chip their health.

## Version History

- In version .65a6, its [Dual Gatlings]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) were replaced by [Medium Flaks]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets).
- Max [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) increased from 700/925 to 1000/1000, [Medium Flak Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) count increased from 2 to 3 in version .65b
- Gained a 3rd Medium Flak Cannon, a Light Flak Cannon and partshifting was fixed in version .72d

## Trivia 

- On the front of the previous model, there are bumps that appear to have been six tiny [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- One of the only ships to be reskinned as an Admin ship.
