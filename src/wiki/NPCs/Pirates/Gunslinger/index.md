{{< shipInfobox >}}

The **_Gunslinger_** is a powerful [**Cruiser**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) that has rather uniqueÂ [Medium Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) mounted on top of the ship.

## Description

The **Gunslinger** is a low-cost ship, good at supporting in attacking bases and defending against other ships as the Cannons deal massive damage. It comes at a cost though, as it is slow and not as maneuverable as most other [Cruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).

## Appearance

The interior of the **Gunslinger** is sparsely decorated. It only has a small pilot's seat in front with a few team-colored parts near it.

## Advantages

- Decent durability.
- Relatively low cost.
- Wreaks havoc on [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) and anything you can hit with your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).
- Decent health for a [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers).
- Cheap.
- Amazing swarm ship.

## Disadvantages

- Comparatively low [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) firepower.
- Low damage against shield.
- Vulnerable alone.
- Rather large for a Cruiser.

## Strategy

- Make maximum use of the spinal weapons which can do tons of damage if hitting a target.
- A good choice for a beginner to help out in a siege.
- Stay in a group of stronger ships and always be behind them when sieging so you won't take damage.
- Defend your base by aiming at the bigger ships with your [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals).

## Version History

- <span>It received a minor remake to the model as well as the addition of 2 [Light Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) in around versions .47 - .48.</span>
- Spinal barrel interval decreased from 0.5s to 0.1s in version .66b.
- Cannon spinal size increased from Large to Huge in version .66b.
- Cannon spinals changed to 4 Medium instead of 2 Huge in version .66b.
- Remodeled by EvilPleeber119 in version .66b.
- Added trails and the Front turret is no longer off center in version .75a27.

## Trivia

- Some pilots call this a "Mini-[Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker)". However, the old [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker)'s [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) are actually based on this ship.
- It was remade once before being added into the game.
- Ironically, it became more maneuverable, and the description of the ship has become outdated since the remodel.
