## Description

![Rare Ore Quadrants, showing the Dead Zone as
red.](OreQuadrants.png "Rare Ore Quadrants, showing the Dead Zone as red.")_For information on [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) read the [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) page._ **_Ores_** are rocky materials used mainly to build ships and the make credits. These materials are a core part of mining.

Ores have a mass which is measured in Cubic Meters, which, in Galaxy, is a measurement of how much space the Ore will take up in a ship's Ore Hold, Cargo Hold, or in a player's [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse). This is something to keep in mind when Trading or Mining because it can affect the amount of money players make.

Each Ore mined spawns a new Ore somewhere in the server, **however, when a server is in _[Endgame]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Endgame)_ status, Ores will have their spawns disabled**, though ores will start spawning again **if** there are more than 2 Factions in [Endgame]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Endgame) state.

**_All_** ships in the [Build Menu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu) _(excluding the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) and [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm))_ require at least some Silicate, Carbon, and Iridium. Higher tier ships require Adamantite, Quantium, Titanium, and Palladium as well as Uranium.

### Locations

**Common Ores**; Silicate, Carbon and Iridium are found commonly scattered throughout the map of Galaxy. These ores also spawn in a large cluster near [Starbases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) and [Planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets).

**Rare Ores**; Adamantite, Palladium, Titanium and Quantium, are only found in what is called a **Quadrant**. A Quadrant is any of the four parts into which a plane is divided by rectangular coordinate axes lying in that plane. In this case, axes that separates the Quadrants is called a _Dead Zone_, in which little to no rare ores can be found. More explanation can be found below.

**Uranium Ore**; Uranium Ore, a unique type of ore, is found scattered all around the map just like Common Ores, but is much more scarce and harder to find.

In the image shown on the right, the map highlights the 4 Quadrants on the 4 Corners and the middle square being [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), these are where Rare Ores of each type spawn on each one of quadrants. The Red Zone shows where it is not possible for Rare Ores to spawn. Keep in mind that 2 Types of Rare Ores **cannot** spawn at the same quadrant _(e,g Palladium and Quantium at the same time cannot be on the magenta quadrant_).

_Note: Rare Ore types are not fixed in 1 Quadrant, instead they are randomized after each round reset or server reset._

## Silicate

_One of the most common ores involved in intergalactic development. Provides for a variety of niches, primarily used as a foundation for spaceship chassis._

## Carbon

_An element well known as part of organic-based compounds, carbon has a wide array of applications that satisfy many needs in spaceship construction._

<div style="display: inline-block;">
<hr />
</div>

## Iridium

_Iridium's resistance to corrosion and easy wear make it a common material utilized in thruster arrays and recalibration systems; from the smallest single-man frigates to the largest dreadnoughts._

</div>

## Adamanite

_Glistening in beautiful shades of red, adamantite forms with an incredibly resistant crystalline structure. Its physical strengths make it a valuable mineral for reinforced hulls and ships that perform in extreme environments._

<div style="display: inline-block;">

</div>

## Quantium

_An alien metal in nature, Quantium's unique magnetic properties came to culminate in the form of the first shield systems developed by humanity. Though many extraterrestrials figured this out before us, quantium's manipulation is still well understood by human-ran manufacturers._

<div style="display: inline-block;">
<hr />
</div>

## Titanium

_The titan in titanium does not lie: titanium is the superior element to build immensely strong structures. Though it is more often used in stations and starbases, titanium pairs best with other similarly strong elements to construct powerful multi-layered plating._

<div style="display: inline-block;">
<hr />
</div>

## Palladium

_Acting as a catalyst for various reactions, palladium often sees use in both kinetic and electric weaponry, being the basis for every single turret core and energy beam in the air._

</div>

## Uranium

_For its rarity and value in the galactic market, uranium serves a much simpler purpose: fuel to feed the most voracious of engines and propulsion systems. It's a good thing that the uranium from these asteroids is relatively pure!_
