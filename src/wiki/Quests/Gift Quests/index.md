In the Christmas Event 2021, Part 2 contained new ships via quests.

These quests were:

- **210**. The First Gift

- **211**. The Second Gift

- **212**. The Third Gift

The location of these quests are inside the 'chimney' (see pictures below) at Mega Base, go into it and jump up, you would be TP'ed to a pathway of 3 to the quests.

The Second Gift would award [Mantid]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mantid) (Dreadnought) for 400 Snowflakes and 275,000 Credits
