## Quest Dialogue

<u>Kneall Harbour Master:</u> "I see you know the language of the Ancients."

<u>Player:</u> "Who are you?"

<u>Kneall Harbour Master:</u> "I am the [Kneall Harbour Master]\*"

<u>Player:</u> "I've heard about your kind, you kill everyone."

<u>Kneall Harbour Master:</u> "Normally yes, but there are dire times and we are in need of money."

<u>Player:</u> "How so?"

<u>Kneall Harbour Master:</u> "One of our capital ships carrying valuable cargo never returned. // We've been unable to recover from the financial loss and everything has been slow around here. // Say, you want to pilot one of the best ships?"

<u>Player:</u> "I assume this is the prototype the text spoke of."

<u>Kneall Harbour Master:</u> "That's right, but constructing it is not cheap."

<u>Player:</u> "Well how much are we talking?"

<u>Kneall Harbour Master:</u> "The construction and my personal fee will set you back by 2,000,000 credits."

<u>Player:</u> "That's crazy!"

<u>Kneall Harbour Master:</u> "I'd say it's worth it, it's one of the most powerful ships in our fleet."

<u>Player:</u> "I'll get back to you when I have the money."

<u>Kneall Harbour Master:</u> "I'm glad to hear. You may be the first human that I can call a friend."

## Trivia

- According to the Aqueous translation, the quest giver is called the "harbo**u**r" master, as opposed to the common American spelling "Harbor," without the letter U.
- The harbour master's tale of an empire without funding could explain the lack of aliens spawning in the game for a few weeks at one point. However, the alien spawn rate issues have been confirmed as a bug in the game, and they were not canon.
- While talking, another response you can say is "IT'S A KNEALL, RUN!!!".
