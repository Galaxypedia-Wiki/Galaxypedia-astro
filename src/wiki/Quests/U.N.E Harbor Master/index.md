## Description

The U.N.E Harbor Master is the quest giver for Quest #5 - "Give U.N.E Harbor Master <u>2 million credits</u> for the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1)." In the pre-quest dialogue, he explains that the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) is the largest and deadliest warship created to date, but he also states that the ship had been in production for a long time. The U.N.E Harbor Master no longer gives a quest for the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) and now is the dealer for the [Weapon Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores), which requires 30500 [Uranium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) and 182500 Credits. ![centre|thumb|720x720px]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}UNE-Harbour-Masterrr.png-"centre|thumb|720x720px")

<u>U.N.E. Harbor Master:</u> "Welcome to the U.N.E Recruiting Outpost, how [may]\* I help you?"

<u>Player:</u> "What is this prototype ship rumor?"

<u>U.N.E. Harbor Master:</u> "Ah yes, that's our largest war vessel to date. Designed and constructed by me."

<u>U.N.E. Harbor Master:</u> "If you had 2 million credits, sure."

<u>Player:</u> "That's a lot of credits..."

<u>U.N.E. Harbor Master:</u> "Do you have any idea how much time it takes to construct this type of ship?"

_("Quest #5 - Prototype X-1 Quest" appears in Quest Menu)_

_\*actual dialogue says "many," not "may."_

## Glitches

- The quest dialogue bubble is broken in VIP servers, this is in the process of being fixed. Public servers are not affected by this.
