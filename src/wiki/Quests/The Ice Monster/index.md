**_The Ice Monster_,** located on the planet [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous), was an NPC that gave out a unique quest for the [2017 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017). After players spoke to the monster, they were instructed to bring 15 [Snowflakes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowflake) back to the NPC. ([Snowflakes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowflake) were found scattered across the map in [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) and [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous)). After you brought the Ice Monster 15 [Snowflakes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowflake), he would reward you with a limited event [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) called the [_Blizzard_]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blizzard).
