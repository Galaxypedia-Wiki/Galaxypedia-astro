**_Billy Ray Joe_** is a quest NPC first implemented alongside [**Luca Sky**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Luca-Sky) in the [**Galaxy Star Wars Event**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Star-Wars-Event) to give players a promotional item quest.

## Description

**Billy Ray Joe** gives the player Quest #2 -- Going Nuclear, which requires the player to mine 20 [Uranium Ore]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) and dump it at [Derelict Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Derelict-Station). The quest would reward players credits and the [Galactic Sun Hat](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/566778868/Galactic-Sun-Hat) upon completion. Refined Uranium will not work, it has to be mined uranium ore.

As of the latest version, completion of Quest #2 rewards players with 1,750 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}credits).  

## Location

**Billy Ray Joe** can be found beside the update board and in front of the Alien Embassy in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) between terminals A and B.

## Quest Dialogue

<u>Billy Ray Joe</u>: "Hey are you a miner?"

<u>Player:</u> "Sometimes..." or "No, not really."

<u>Billy Ray Joe</u>: "Well we have a big problem, the Derelict Station has a failing Nuclear Core and it needs Uranium to keep running."

<u>Player</u>: "Where am I supposed to get Uranium from?"

<u>Billy Ray Joe</u>: "The base was built near uranium asteroids, there still might be some nearby."

<u>Player</u>: "Ok I'll see if I can fine some Uranium." or "Sounds dangerous, count me out."

<u>Billy Ray Joe</u>: "Ok great, once you gather 20 Uranium Ore, dock at the Derelict Station and use the menu to dump the ore."

_You have a new quest: Going Nuclear -- Quest #2 appears in Quest Menu_

_Note that all secondary options (those that come after "or") will end the quest dialogue at that point._
