## Description

This quest is one of the quests you need to do to obtain the [Kraken]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken).

## Starting the Quest

The quest is started after you talk to a scientist named Jack Kendall, which is aboard Lucifer Station. You can find Jack in his lab by going through the waste disposal system in the kitchen or by using the security door ([VIP]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass) required).

## Quest Dialogue

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: Hm? Ah, hello! You must be the merc I requested.

<u>Player</u>: Yep! That's me alright.

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: Great! As I mentioned in the agreement, I would tell you the job in person.

<u>Player</u>: What do you need me to do?

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: A ship I had been working on was stolen from me. It is the only prototype built.

<u>Player</u>: How was this ship even stolen?

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: Pirates! They hijacked it through the on board AI while I was in transit.

<u>Player</u>: I haven't been told what you want me to do.

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: Right, right. The ship needs to be destroyed. It can't let it stay in the wrong hands. Who knows what they will do with it.

<u>Player</u>: That's it? Just destroy the ship?

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: You will also need to bring back a piece of its armor as proof you have completed your task.

<u>Player</u>: What will be my reward?

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: After the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) is destroyed, I won't have to use its activator blueprints and spare parts.

<u>Player</u>: Are you going to tell me where this [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) is?

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: The on board AI is still able to send out a beacon. Just follow the signal and you will find it.

<u>Player</u>: Where will the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) be?

<u>Jack Kendall</u>: I'll set out a beacon, its backup AI will send it here.

## Completing the Quest

After you talk to the scientist, the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) will spawn and roam the map (only if the spawn cooldown is inactive). Killing the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) will have it drop Kodiak Armor Pieces, 3 of which and 800k credits are required to complete the quest. After you finish the quest, the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) spawn cooldown will start. The quest also gives the Kodiak Activator, which is used in [Depthbreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Depthbreaker). Only spawn the [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak) if you are prepared and have a team ready, as it can destroy a [Level 2 Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and many [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) alone.
