<span style="color:#ee7600">[Collins]: Hey there.</span>

[Player]: Do you know how to make Kraken Armor?

<span style="color:#ee7600">[Collins]: I need 4,000 Titanium, 2 Kodaik Platings, and 30 Armored Platings.</span>

[Player]: I'll take it. Here's the materials.

<span style="color:#ee7600">[Collins]: Yep, here you go. Thanks.</span>

## Trivia

- **Collins** where unanchored before. Therefor, allowing players to push the NPC around and even move it outside of the planet.
- <s>No longer in use due to the fact Smith now sells the Armor Platings instead of Collins at the Mega Base.</s>
