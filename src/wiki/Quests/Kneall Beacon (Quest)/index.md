## Description

Interaction with 2 Beacons are required to spawn a [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold). The first is in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), and the other is on the surface of [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad).

The first Kneall Beacon (The one in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base)) makes the [Beacon Activator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Beacon-Activator), which is then used in the Kneall Beacon on [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad). After completing the second Activator, a wave of Kneall ships will spawn. Once those are defeated, the [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold) will spawn. ![Items required to obtain the Beacon
