---

The **_Grim Reaper_**was an **[NPC]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs)** that was added during the [**Halloween Event 2018**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2018).

## Description

The **Grim Reaper** is the [NPC]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) that would give you an extremely powerful ship called the [Grim]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim) for completing the quest that he gave; Death Incarnate. The quest required 100 [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) and 5 [Ghost Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghost-Pumpkin).

## Location

The **Grim Reaper** is located in the [Halloween Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Mega-Base) in the pumpkin field.

## Quest Dialog 1

<u>Grim Reaper</u>: Hey, want to do me a favor?

<u>Player</u>: What is the favor?

<u>Grim Reaper</u>: I noticed that the king reached his final form of evolution

<u>Player</u>: Go on.

<u>Grim Reaper</u>: I want you to defeat the king and loot everything he drops.

<u>Player</u>: What do i need to get from him?

<u>Grim Reaper</u>: You will need to get me 5 Ghost Pumpkins and 100 Space Pumpkins

<u>Player</u>: What will my reward be?

<u>Grim Reaper</u>: If you get me those, I will give you my true ship

<u>Player</u>: I'll do it

<u>Grim Reaper</u>: Good, be careful, because he is quite powerful right now.

_Player obtains quest: Death Incarnate_

## Completing the Quest (continued)

The player then needs to obtain 5 [Ghost Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghost-Pumpkin) and 100 [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) by defeating a stage 3 [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King). This can be extremely difficult as the [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) can take on multiple [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) if distractions such as the [Draco]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Draco) and [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) are not present. Once destroyed there will probably be many vultures, so stay alert. Each stage 3 [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) drops 1 [Ghost Pumpkin]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ghost-Pumpkin) and 25 [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin). Since a [Harvest King]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Harvest-King) only spawns once per round, the player must hop servers if they wish to continue. After obtaining the requirements the player must head back to the **Grim Reaper** to turn in the pumpkins for their prize.

## Quest Dialog 2

<u>Grim Reaper:</u> You got all the pumpkins?

<u>Player</u>: I got all the pumpkins

<u>Grim Reaper</u>: ...

_The quest has now been completed, the player is awarded the [Grim]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim)._

## Trivia
