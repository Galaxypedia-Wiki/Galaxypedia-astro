## Trivia

- In .77e6, **cswimr** was relocated from [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion) to **Lucifer station** for unknown reasons. Many players believe this relocation was a reference to **Among Us**, as the NPC now hides within the station's ventilation system, similar to the popular game's gameplay mechanic.
