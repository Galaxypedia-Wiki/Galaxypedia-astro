title: Christmas Luca Sky
---

**_Christmas Luca Sky_** is the Christmas variant of **[Luca Sky]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Luca-Sky)**.

## Description

**Christmas Luca Sky** appears to be some kind of ice cyborg. Not much else is different, as he still gives [Quest #1 -- Help the Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Luca-Sky).

## Trivia

- **Christmas Luca Sky** makes a reappearance in the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).
- When he reappeared in the Christmas Event, his programming was actually different. Instead of the quest appearing all the time, he will only give the quest if the [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base) is spawned.
