**<u>NOTE: ADVANCED SHIPS ARE NO LONGER BEING SOLD AT TERMINAL D AND NO LONGER UNDERGO ROTATION, INSTEAD, THE ADVANCED SHIPS ARE NOW SOLD AT TERMINAL C (TALK TO SEAN IN THE UNE DEPOT)</u>**

## Description

The **_Advanced Ship Computers_** were a group of Computers used to sell [Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships), and was only the source.

## Ship Rotation

Advanced Ship Computers used to have what is called a **Ship Rotation**. Ship Rotation decides what [Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) should be On-sale and Off-sale for the month. This made [Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) have a semi-limited status.

## Quests

Each Advanced Ship Computer had an image icon of an [Advanced Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships). This dictates what [Advanced Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships) it sold. This was then changed to be moved in terminal C instead of the original terminal D

## Version History

- Some of the **Ship Computers** were disabled, in version .66b excluding those for the [Galaxy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy) and the [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).

<!-- -->

- [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) Remodeled in version .75. Due to this, [Super Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) Computers were removed, and all Ship Computers were remodeled to have a pinkish style.
- Advanced rotation was then changed to not appear where the computers were usually held, instead they were put in the U.N.E terminal (C)

## Trivia

- [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis) was the only Advanced Ship to not be sold by the computers.
- The **Ship Computers** in Terminal D replaced the dining hall room.
- The [Battlecruiser-ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) [Bombe]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bombe) has an identical appearance mimicking the computer.
- The Dialogue on some of the Advanced Ship Computers is identical of that from [Shady Dealer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shady-Dealer), a past seller of [Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships).
- Before [Super Capital Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) were moved to the [Build Menu]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Build-Menu), they were previously sold at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) at computer dealers, and did not require [SC Build Permits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Permits).
- Some of the pictures on the computers were wrong, e.g. the picture for the slipstream was instead an [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris), this was believed to simply be a mistake in development.
