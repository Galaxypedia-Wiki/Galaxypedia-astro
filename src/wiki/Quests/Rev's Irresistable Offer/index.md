---

## Description

**"Rev's Irresistable Offer"** is a [quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quests) that gives the item [Weapons Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Weapons-Part) used to make extremely powerful ships.

**[Rev]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rev)** is the quest giver NPC that allows players to start Quest #206 "Rev's Irresistable Offer"

The Items that the quest needs to build the [Weapons Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Weapons-Part) are the following:

- 32,500 [Uranium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining#Ores)
- 10 [Armored Plating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armored-Plating)
- 182,500 Credits

## Location

Rev can be found in the lower interior of [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion) near the cliff that [Collins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Collins) stands on. As was the case with [Collins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Collins), this quest may only be accessed once Frion is upgraded to level two, which enables a teleporter near the top tower that takes players to the interior space below the main starbase/spawning zone.
