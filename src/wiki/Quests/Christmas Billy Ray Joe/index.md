**_Christmas Billy Ray Joe_** is the Christmas version of [**Billy Ray Joe**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Billy-Ray-Joe).

## Description

This version of [Billy Ray Joe]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Billy-Ray-Joe) was released in the [Christmas Event 2017]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017). He appears to be wearing some [Frost Guard General](https://www.roblox.com/bundles/194/Frost-Guard-General) armor. He served the same purpose as Billy Ray Joe, acting as the start and completion point for the "Going Nuclear" quest.

## Trivia

- **Christmas Billy Ray Joe** also appeared in the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018).
- There is only one small change in his programming. Instead of the quest dialogue always appearing for those who have not yet completed [Quest #2 -- Going Nuclear]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Billy-Ray-Joe), the quest dialogue will now only appear when the [Derelict Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Derelict-Station) [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) is in a server.
