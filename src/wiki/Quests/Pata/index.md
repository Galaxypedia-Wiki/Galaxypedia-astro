**_Pata_** is an NPC who offers two services related to [Armor Scrap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armor-Scrap).

## Description

Deep within the cave system lies **Pata**'s Armor Scrapper Facility, a specialized operation where the mysterious figure, marked by his distinctive black cowboy hat and mustache, oversees the dismantling of advanced technology. The facility is a blend of industrial efficiency and improvised engineering, with an old-world western aesthetic meeting high-tech salvage operations. Throughout the facility, various workstations showcase the systematic approach to salvage operations - from initial assessment terminals to component storage units. The environment maintains a purposefully dim atmosphere, broken only by strategic yellow lighting that illuminates key work areas. Diamond plate flooring and reinforced structures suggest this facility was built to handle heavy-duty operations, while the scattered mechanical components and tools indicate active dismantling projects.

**Pata** has carved out quite a niche in this underground operation, transforming what was once just a cave into a sophisticated spacecraft scrapping facility. Currently being dismantled is a [Dragoon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragoon) vessel, one of many common [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) ships that prowl space looking for easy targets - though in **Pata**'s facility, it's just another day's worth of salvage to be broken down into valuable, reusable components.
