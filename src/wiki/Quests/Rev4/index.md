<span style="color:#ee7600">Rev4: WHO?</span>

<span style="color:#ee7600">Rev4: ASKED FOR YOU TO SPEAK</span>

_Player receives quest #20206, "Spooky"._

## Trivia

- The quest that gives most expensive craftable item in the game, at 3 million credits, formerly the [Weapon Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rev).
- Currently the Lucifer Core has no use, and if you do the quest, you would get the items back.
