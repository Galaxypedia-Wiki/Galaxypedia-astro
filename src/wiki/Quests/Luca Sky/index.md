![Luca Sky inside [Mega
Base](Mega_Base "wikilink")](Luca_sky.png "Luca Sky inside Mega Base") **_Luca Sky_** is a Quest NPC added during the [**Galaxy Star Wars Event**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Star-Wars-Event) alongside [**Billy Ray Joe**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Billy-Ray-Joe).

## Description

**Luca Sky** used to give the player Quest #1 -- Help the Freedom Base, which required players to deliver three [Medicine & Supplies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Medicine-&-Supplies) to the [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base). 

A [Pirate Avenger]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirates) spawned at the [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base) upon accepting the quest, making it harder to simply dock and sell the medicine to the station. Upon completion players were be given a few credits and, during the promotional event, the [Interstellar Sunglasses](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/566779626/Interstellar-Sunglasses). In the latest version before the quest was disabled, the [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base) quest gave players a reward of 300 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits).  

Quests number 1 and 2 were disabled later on, though their respective quest NPCs still linger in the Mega Base. Both **Luca Sky** and Billy Ray Joe currently serve no purpose and are simply vestigial game assets no longer in use.

## Location

**Luca Sky** can be found inside the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) between terminals C and D, beside the Alien translation board and in front of an ad display board.

## Quest Dialogue

<u>Luca Sky</u>: "Oh this is terrible! Someone please help me!"

<u>Player</u>: "What's wrong?" or "I don't have time for this."

<u>Luca Sky</u>: "A strange plague has broken out at the Freedom Base and they need Medicine & Supplies badly."

<u>Player</u>: "So what's the problem?"

<u>Luca Sky</u>: "I tried to bring them Medicine & Supplies but some filthy pirates blew up my ship before I could get there."

<u>Player</u>: "Let me do it then!" or "Sorry I can't help you."

<u>Luca Sky</u>: "Ok good luck! You'll need to bring the Freedom Base 3 crates of Medicine & Supplies."

_You have a new quest: Help the Freedom Base -- Quest #1 appears in Quest Menu_

<u>Player</u>: "Where do I get the stuff from?" or "Goodbye!"

<u>Luca Sky</u>: "Ill put them in your warehouse, they are rather large so you'll need to use your [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm)."

_Note that all secondary options (those that come after "or") will end the quest dialogue at that point._
