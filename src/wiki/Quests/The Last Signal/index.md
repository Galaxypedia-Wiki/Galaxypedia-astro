{{< notices/removed >}}

**_The Last Signal_** is a quest NPC first implemented alongside [The Nautilus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nautilus) Wreck to give players the Kneall Core.

## Description

The Last Signal is a quest that is required to build the Kneall Core.

**_Nautilus Wreck_** is the quest giver NPC that allows players to start [Quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quests) #202, "The Last Signal". which allows players to acquire the 1 count of "Kneall Core" which is required to build the [Obliterator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Obliterator).

**_IMPORTANT NOTE: The quest can only be completed once._**

The Items that the quest needs to build the Kneall Core are the following:

- 6 [Armored Plating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armored-Plating)
- 3 [Antimatter Shard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Antimatter-Shard)
- 2 [Alien Device]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alien-Device)
- 1 [Ascension Crystal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ascension-Crystal)
- 1 [Quantum Core]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quantum-Core)

## Location

The **Nautilus Wreck** can be found somewhere around the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) with a radius of 70k+ Studs. It always spawns beside a pile of ship wrecks ([Ship Wrecks of Sector 552]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E-Battle-of-Sector-552-Wreckage)) which is simpler to spot.

To find it, you must first find the [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) wreck at the bottom of the Wreckages, then find a [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) beside it, then find the direction of the [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) where it is pointing at the Nautilus Wreck at its backside with its wrecked thrusters. Then travel 10k in the direction from where the back of the [Swarmer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Swarmer) is facing. _(Note that the Nautilus Wreck is quite challenging to spot even with this guide)_ ![centre|Video guide on the location of the Nautilus
