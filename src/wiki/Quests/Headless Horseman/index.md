title: Headless Horseman
---

The **_Headless Horseman_** was an [**NPC**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) added in the [**Halloween 2017 Event**]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2017). He was the quest giver for "Halloween Quest".

## Description

The **Headless Horseman** was an NPC based on the American folktale. He would spawn in the [Halloween Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Mega-Base) and would give "Halloween Quest".

## Halloween Quest

The Halloween Quest is started after you speak to the **Headless Horseman**. He will give you a quest to collect 5 [Space Pumpkins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Space-Pumpkin) and put them in your [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse). To obtain a Space Pumpkin, you would have to defeat the [Grim Reaper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim-Reaper), which would spawn in servers. Once the Grim Reaper is destroyed, it would drop 0-4 Space Pumpkins.

Fighting the [Grim Reaper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Grim-Reaper) was not easy, as it was very powerful and could solo multiple [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). However, some skilled pilots killed the Grim Reaper without help. The Grim Reaper's map icon was similar to the [Alien Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens).

After you complete the quest, you would be rewarded with the [Reaper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Reaper).
