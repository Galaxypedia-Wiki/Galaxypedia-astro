The **_Shady Dealer_** is a quest NPC previously used to give out [Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships).

## Description

The **Shady Dealer** was a hidden vendor NPC that sold [advanced ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships). His location and the ship that he sold changed every month.

During the [April Fool's Event of 2020]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}April-Fool's-Event-2020), the Shady Dealer was "killed" and gave out the [Baby Tyrant]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Baby-Tyrant) as his "final sale." The new rotation ship NPC is [Eduardo]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Eduardo). _Please move to Eduardo's page for current information on rotation ships._

During re-release of the [Prototypes]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes), he was one of the two [NPC]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) quest merchants that sold the prototypes. The **Shady Dealer**used to sell the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) for 6 Million Credits, and 1 [Weapons Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Weapons-Part).

## Prototype Rebirth

Just like with the [Shady Alien Dealer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shady-Alien-Dealer), the **Shady Dealer** used be found somewhere in [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad) through a teleporter in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) (left Alien Embassy door). The teleporter itself used to become active after [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad) was upgraded to planet level 3. During this period, the shady dealer sold the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1).

### Trivia

- During the Prototype Rebirth, just like with the [Shady Alien Dealer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shady-Alien-Dealer), if you attempted to scam the **Shady Dealer** for the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) without enough of the needed Credits and materials, you would not only be denied access to obtaining the ship, but your materials would be taken out of your [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse).
- During [Halloween 2019]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Halloween-Event-2019), the **Shady Dealer** was reintroduced into the game and given the functionality of selling [advanced ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships). This has been the **Shady Dealer's** purpose since.
