**Hide and Seek** involves a two part quest inside the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

## <span style="color:red">(OLD)</span> Description

doman90, the first quest vendor, is the starting point of the quest. Talking to him leads you to having to find GodrevyD ([Rev]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rev)), the second quest vendor. Upon finding and talking the second quest vendor, you will obtain the [Revylation ü¶ç]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Revylation-ü¶ç). The cost of obtaining it is very low, approximately 1-5 credits **(?)**. ![doman90,Used for admins to spawn
