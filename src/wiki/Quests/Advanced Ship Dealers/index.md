_This page is about the Advanced Ship Dealers, which was removed. Go to the [Advanced Ship Computers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Advanced-Ship-Computers) page for the current dealers._

The **Advanced Ship Dealers** were previous hidden quest [NPCs]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) that allowed players to purchase [Advanced Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}advanced-ships).

## Description

Originally, only one NPC, the [Shady Dealer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shady-Dealer), sold Advanced Ships. After the events of the 2020 April Fool's event, the Shady Dealer was "killed," and two different [NPCs]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) have since taken his place.

All **Advanced Ship Dealers** follow a pattern of being hidden in random places around the map, often on NPC bases or Planets.

In his quests, his name is the "Shady Soldier" and he wears a U.N.E uniform.

Eduardo used to sell the [Osiris]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Osiris) for 2,000,000 credits. He can be found in a hidden room underneath the stairs inside [Derelict Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Derelict-Station). The wall with a laser gun is non-collidable and can be used to walk around the stairs to Eduardo's hiding spot.
