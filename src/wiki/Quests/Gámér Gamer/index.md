## Description

**Gámér Gamer** was the Quest NPC for the [Christmas Event 2018]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2018). He gave players the now-removed [Quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quests) #14 - "Rennovator Innevator." **Gámér** was seen working on the ice around a frozen ship. He was wearing a rather high-tech spacesuit to protect him from [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous)'s freezing temperatures. He was subsequently removed from the game with the end of the Christmas Event. ![centre|thumb|800x800px]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}GamerGamer.png-"centre|thumb|800x800px")
