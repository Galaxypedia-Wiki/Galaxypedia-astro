## Description

The **_Shady Alien Dealer_** was one of the two [NPC]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) quest exchangers that gave away the purchasable [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) during the second re-release of the [Prototypes]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}prototypes) for 5 Million Credits, 1 [Weapons Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Materials), and 1 [Alien Device]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Materials). The **Shady Alien Dealer** is similar to the [Kneall Harbor Master]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Harbor-Master) as the [NPC]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}npcs) is able to give the powerful [Super Capital Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) in exchange for Credits and materials. Unlike the [Kneall Harbor Master]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Harbor-Master) however, there is no official affiliation for which faction the [Shady Alien Dealer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shady-Alien-Dealer) represents and can only be assumed to have illegally obtained digital blueprints for the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2). ![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shady-Alien-Dealer.png-"Shady-Alien-Dealer.png")

## Location

Just like with the [Shady Dealer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shady-Dealer), the **Shady Alien Dealer** can be found somewhere in [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad) through a teleporter in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) (left door of the Alien Embassy). The teleporter itself becomes active after [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad) is upgraded to Starbase level 3.

## Trivia

- Just like with the [Shady Dealer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shady-Dealer), if you attempt to scam the **Shady Alien Dealer** for the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) without enough of the needed Credits and materials, you will not only be denied access to obtaining the ship, but your materials WILL be taken out of your [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse).
- 1 [Weapons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Materials) Part costs up to 1.2 Million Credits worth of [Uranium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Materials) (30500 to be exact), and will fill up a level 30 [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse).
