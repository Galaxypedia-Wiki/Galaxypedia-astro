**Richard Kavar** is the quest giver NPC for Quest #9 -- "Crazy Secret".

## Description

**Richard Kavar** is seen in a slumped over position next to a glowing interface station. His suit is also covered in various glowing readouts, unlike the relatively plain suits seen on dead personnel inside the [Abandoned U.N.E Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Abandoned-U.N.E-Base). ![centre|thumb|720x720px]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Richard-Kavar1.png-"centre|thumb|720x720px")

## Location

Richard Kavar can be found inside a "secret" research lab inside [Myriad's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad) moon, Duna'ka√©. The quest is never locked and has no prerequisites other than having some form of transportation to the moon. The quest also comes with an _optional_ pre-quest dialogue from the [Monogram]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Monogram), which is unlike any other quest in Galaxy. ![centre|thumb|600x600px]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kavarlocation.png-"centre|thumb|600x600px")

## Quest Dialogue

### Optional Monogram Dialogue:

<u>Monogram</u>: "Hello human, Please, be careful"

<u>Player</u>: "What do you mean 'be careful'" or "[EXIT]"**\***

<u>Monogram</u>: "User Richard Kavar is dangerous and is currently wanted for the murder of his 2 co-workers, he is armed and is suffering // from PTSD thinking he is being hunted by Kneall and Red Ice [withdrawal]"

<u>Player</u>: "What the hell happened here"

<u>Monogram</u>: "During the fall of the body known as "Myriad" Richard became distressed as the horror that happened on the surface and took // a shuttle down, his mood has been down ever since"

<u>Player</u>: "What exactly happened on Myriad?"

<u>Monogram</u>: "Kneall attacked the colony, the [remnants] can still be found on the surface"

<u>Player</u>: "What about his co-workers"

<u>Monogram</u>: "Due to the fact that the facility was not harmed, he convinced himself that his co-workers were Kneall, he killed them and their bodies out the door, what happened after that is unknown"

<u>Player</u>: "Can I talk to him?

<u>Monogram</u>: "Go ahead, he is currently in a somber type ramble, his is still armed however"

_End Dialogue. Note that the dialogue is kept as similar to the real in-game text as possible. Grammar and general English mistakes are present to maintain similarity to the true dialogue. The same remains true in the Main Dialogue._

## Trivia

- The [Monogram's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Monogram) mention of "red ice" could be a reference to abused substances seen in video games, most recently appearing as a widely abused substance in _Detroit: Become Human_.
- The [Monogram]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Monogram) appears to be hiding around the corner of the wall between the holographic display and area where **Richard Kavar** has partly collapsed.
- The dialogue bubble above the [Monogram]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Monogram) is blue rather than red, signifying that it is not _required_ for the quest.![centre]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}KavarMonogram1.png-"centre"){width="700" height="700"}
