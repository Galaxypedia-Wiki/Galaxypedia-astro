**_Frion_** is a large [**Planet**]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) in Galaxy and the first to be added since the removal of [Earth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Earth).

## Description

**Frion** is currently the second largest planet in Galaxy by the size of its atmosphere, which appears light purple on the outside and is 4,400 studs in diameter. The inside of the atmosphere is an orange-tan color. **Frion** was the second planet to ever be added, the first being [Earth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Earth) when the game was in Alpha, but that has since been removed. **Frion** has 20,00 Shields and 20,000 hull at its base level.

**Frion** can be upgraded twice. Level 2 costs 3,000 Credits, adding turrets and a large structure atop **Frion**. Level 3 costs 6,000 Credits, adding more turrets.

### <u>Lucifer Station</u>

**Lucifer Station** is a small station that orbits **Frion**, which can be entered through a [Lucifer] teleporter in the main base. Upon entering the **Lucifer Station**, you'll be greeted by long open hallways and three different rooms, each decorated with furniture. In the corner of the Cafe, next to the stove, [cswimr]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}cswimr) is revealed hiding inside the vents. He offers you a powerful [Kneall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall) ship in exchange for materials, Kneall parts, and credits.

### <u>Communications tower/Temple</u>

The communications tower on top of **Frion** is a method of accessing the cavern in **Frion**. For it to appear, **Frion** must be level 2. Either by stepping on to the crack at top **Frion** or into one of the doors on the tower, you will be teleported to the cave.

### <u>Cave</u>

**Frion's** cave features a small body of water and some grasses/ground cover growing. There are two NPCs: [Rev]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rev) and [Collins]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Collins). Rev offers a quest for constructing the [Weapons Part]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Weapons-Part), costing 32,500 Uranium, 10 [Armored Plating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armored-Plating), and 185,000 Credits. This weapons part is used in the construction of [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) and [Borealis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Borealis). Collins offers a quest for constructing the [Kraken Armor]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken-Armor), costing 4,000 Titanium, 2 [Kodiak Plating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak-Plating) and 30 Armored Plating. This Kodiak Armor is used for the [Kraken]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken).

### <u>Ores</u>

## Assimilation

**Frion**, like any NPC base, can be assimilated when a faction's territory overpowers its own. However, all planets can also be captured -- whichever team brings the planet's health to 0 will, instead of destroying the planet, take over **Frion**. **Frion** can be a useful base for early factions, as its economy starts off with lower prices. This makes it much easier to upgrade early-on, allowing teams to get a level 2 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), which is required to spawn more powerful warships. When upgraded, it is an excellent defensive point due to its high amount of heavy-hitting turrets.

## Climate

The climate of **Frion** is not very special; The planet is barren and rocky and isn't able to support life. However, the pressurization required to sustain life in the Starbase appears to have leaked into a cave, as grass is growing under the lab.

- The first [planet]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) to be added to Galaxy after the removal of [Earth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Earth).
- [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous) has less health when compared to that of **Frion**. However, it has two more turrets than **Frion** does once fully upgraded.
- [Aqueous]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aqueous) was generally considered weaker than **Frion**, especially in the earlier days of Aqueous' existence.
- Frion has a small weakspot underneath the main base. The only way to access it is to go into the range of the turrets and hide behind a small bit of rock. The planet actually hits itself while you can be safe from fire. Only ships smaller than the sixfold work for the operation.
- Was the largest planet until the addition of [Pyramus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pyramus).
- Lucifer station used to spawn the [Striker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Striker), the [Nighthawk]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nighthawk), and the [Xenophile]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xenophile).
- Previously it holds 2 NPCs, both of which are used to get the quests known as [Depthbreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Depthbreaker), [Dining In Hell]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dining-In-Hell) which were both used for the getting a special dreadnought, the [Kraken]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kraken).
