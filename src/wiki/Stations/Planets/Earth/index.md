## Description

Earth was the first planet to ever be added to Galaxy. It was added in Pre-Alpha and stayed through Alpha before it was removed in Beta. The planet served as a spawn point from when you first joined and game and also served as the icon and thumbnail for the game. The planet was located just under where the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) is located today, indicating that it may have been a location marker for where theÂ [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) was going to be placed. You could fly your spaceship to it, jump out and walk around. This was a very small planet when compared to others. It appears that [Pangea Proxima]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}wikipedia:Pangaea-Proxima) is forming on it, suggesting a radical jump forward from our time.

Later, the Earth was re-added temporarily for the [2020 April Fools event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}april-fools-2020), in which it served as the starting point for a quest line to receive the [Baby Tyrant]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Baby-Tyrant), although the Freedom Base was later used to pick up the quest.
