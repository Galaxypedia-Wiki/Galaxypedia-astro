**_Aqueous II_**is the second [Planet]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) to be added to Galaxy after the removal of [Earth]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Earth).

## Description

**Aqueous** **II** has a blue atmosphere surrounding it and is similar to the planet [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion). Though the planet is initially unarmed, it receives [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) when upgraded to Level 2 or 3. Players used to be able to start the [Christmas Quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2020) here. **Aqueous II** can have up to 10,000 shield and hull once fully upgraded. Level 1 costs 12,000 credits and level 2 costs 24,000 credits. The planet's base is accessed through a small shelter built within a cave. The planet's surface is covered in snow and ice, and the planet is buffeted by a raging blizzard, adding to the beautiful winter aesthetic. As of version .62c, **Aqueous II** has a ring-like belt of asteroids in close orbit. Most were made out of [Palladium]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) or [Iridium ore]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores). In version .62d, some of these asteroids could be mined, but this feature has since been removed.

Whenever a team's [Territory]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Territory) expands over the planet, the ownership of **Aqueous II** will be transferred to that team. When sieging **Aqueous II**, the final hit will take the base in the same manner as [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion) and [Myriad III]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad-III).

As of version .70c, the planet is now a bright neon blue-white color, and its atmosphere has become frozen and non-collidable. The spawn and dock location has been moved to a white [Corvid]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Corvid) stationed below the remaining asteroid. A cage labeled as "Terminal B" is attached to this ship, allowing one (?) ship to dock at a time and allowing all other normal base functions.

## Interior

The interior of **Aqueous II** is made up of a large floating island divided into two levels, as well as a cave in the top half. The top sides of both levels house a variety of structures and objects. The bottom "level" features a large lab-like building that houses various rooms with unknown purpose. This level is also home to the [Ice Monster]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Ice-Monster), a currently unused quest NPC. The docks for **Aqueous II** are also located here, which at level one are simple platforms with no teleporter. The inside of the shelter has some Alien text.

The top level of the island includes derelict buildings, [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), various rocks, and a frozen-over [MLRS]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}MLRS), and "Gámér Gamer" which suggests the planet has been long abandoned. When upgraded to level two or three, this area gains an energy tower with Alien text on one side.

When the planet is upgraded to level two or three, the shelter gains a much more industrial appearance with large metal structures and laser-beam gates. It also gains new Alien text on the inside of the building. The docks also gain a more metallic appearance and have teleporters nearby. The large turrets on top of **Aqueous II** become restored when the planet is upgraded to level 2.

There is also a small cave below the location of the shelter. This cave is a small complex containing a snowman and various other objects. Players can enter this cave by going into the cave entrance in side of the bottom portion of **Aqueous II**.

Within the top portion of **Aqueous II**, there is a very large cave with very thick fog. For the location of the cave, see Quest #201 - [Dimensional Cache]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dimensional-Cache). Within this cave is 2 campfires hidden throughout the cave. There is also a hidden door that leads to a room with wooden walls. What is contained within this room is currently unknown.

## Quests

**Aqueous II** is the home of 1 current quest and a former quest NPC.

### [Dimensional Cache]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dimensional-Cache) - Quest #201

Within the top section of **Aqueous II**, there is a very large cave that hosts Quest #201 - [Dimensional Cache]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dimensional-Cache)

### Ice Monster - Discontinued Quest

The [Ice Monster]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}The-Ice-Monster) (or Yeti) was a quest NPC for the [Christmas 2017 Quest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2017), which involved collecting snowflakes in a trade to acquire the [Blizzard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blizzard), a unique [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers). After the Christmas event ended, the quest was disabled and [Snowflakes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowflake) no longer spawn, but the Ice Monster remains a permanent figure on the surface of **Aqueous II**.

## Climate

The climate of **Aqueous II** is mostly boreal, the planet is always coated in snow and it is always snowing and quite foggy. The planet does support life, mostly trees however.
