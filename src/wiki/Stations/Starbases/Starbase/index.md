_This page details faction-generated Starbases. For a general list of all starbase structures found in Galaxy, go to the [Starbase Category]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) page._ ![The
current Starbase
Menu](Starbase_menu3.png "The current Starbase Menu"){width="336" height="336"} **Starbase(s)** are the center of operations for player factions and serve as a spawn point for the players in every faction. **Starbases** are crucial for factions, as they are the places where [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) can be [dumped]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining), [sold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading), and [bought]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading).

**Starbases** also serve as safe houses for players as a place to dock and despawn their [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships). When a **Starbase** is destroyed, the [faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) it belongs to is also destroyed, unless the faction owns other bases or [Planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets). The **Starbase** generates credits based on the amount of power and territory it holds. At the start of the game, it has around 70 credits (0 in [Galaxy Arcade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Arcade)). **Starbases** are stationary and are assigned a random position on the map when their faction is created. All [factions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}factions) and **Starbases** are color-coded. When you walk near the center of the **Starbase**, you are greeted with the **Starbase** menu, from which you can open the ship menu, buy and sell items, access a menu to teleport to other bases, loan credits (which isn't available in [Galaxy Arcade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Arcade)), change [Factions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions), and open tutorials. Faction leaders also have additional controls over certain aspects of their **Starbases**. Even though the **Starbase** may seem safe, ships docked there may still be damaged, unless they are freighters or miners that have not been in combat recently. The **Starbase** has an explosion radius of 150 (level 1), 195 (level 2), 254 (level 3), 330 (level 4) and 429 (max level). The **Starbase** also rewards 11% of the value of materials inside it as combat rewards when destroyed.

**Starbases** serve as both the main target and main point of resistance during [Sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging). All **Starbases** have turrets, but higher-level **Starbases** are significantly more powerful. **Starbases** also generate [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) that players can use to defend, with [Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury) at level 1 and 5, and [Starhunters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starhunter) at level 3. From most ranges, **Starbases** deal significant damage to both [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull), but at long range, a **Starbase** generally deals less damage to Hull than to Shield (which is why many [Siege ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}siege-ships) like the [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker) have more Hull health).

## Starbase Levels

A **Starbase** can be one of 5 levels. Higher levels increase the stats and capabilities of the **Starbase**. Increasing the **Starbase** level also allows higher classes of ships to be spawned - Please note that the player must also have spent a certain amount of time in-game, and Supercapitals can only be spawned in Endgame.

### **Level One**

A newly created faction will start off with a level one **Starbase**. At this level, the **Starbase** has four docking ports and can only house four players. The **Starbase** is armed with 2 [Heavy Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Heavy Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) mounted to the bottom of the base, as well as 2 [Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Medium Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) mounted on top. A level one **Starbase** has 25,000 shield health and 25,000 hull health and it is vulnerable against sieges if not protected.

### **Level Two**

This is the second level for a **Starbase**. The **Starbase** must have 5,000 base credits and the upgrade can only be performed by the leader of the faction. Level two **Starbases** gain four more docking ports and a second level, which can be accessed by a teleporting elevator. They can house a maximum of six players. A level two **Starbase** has 30,000 shield health and 30,000 hull health. It also gains 4 [Medium Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 4 [Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) mounted on top and increases the explosion radius to 195. A level two starbase can protect itself against weak sieges.

This **Starbase** level enables the spawning of [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) and [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers).

### **Level Three**

This _used_ to be the last upgrade level for a **Starbase**. The **Starbase** must have 5,000 base credits, 500 silicate, 100 carbon, and 100 iridium to be upgraded. In addition to being able to house up to eight players, this upgrade also adds regenerating [Starhunter]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starhunter) [fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to a hangar in the middle of the Starbase. A level three **Starbase** has 39,000 shield health and 39,000 hull health. Additional armaments added are 4 [Heavy LR Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), 2 [Capital Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 2 [Capital Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) to the top and increases the explosion radius to 254. A level three **Starbase** might be able to stop a medium-sized fleet if protected with its [Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury) and [Starhunters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starhunter).

This **Starbase** level enables the spawning of [Super Capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships).

### **Level Four**

As of version .61f, **Starbases** can be upgraded to level four. This upgrade level requires 10,000 base credits, 1,000 silicate, 250 carbon, and 250 iridium. This level adds another 750 health to both stats, bringing the total up to 54,600 shield health and 54,600 hull health. As of version .68b, this level also adds an additional level to the Starbase, as well as teleporters at each terminal, meaning a maximum of 12 ships can be docked at once. This level also upgrades the damage output, adding 4 [Point Defense Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and 4 [Medium Flak Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), and increases the explosion radius to 330. A level four **Starbase** might be able to stop big sized sieges if the [Starbase Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury), [Starhunters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starhunter) and the protectors work with cooperation.

### **Level Five**

As of version .68b, alongside receiving a remodel, **Starbases** can be upgraded to level five. This upgrade level requires 15,000 base credits, 2,000 silicate, 500 carbon, and 500 iridium. This level adds another 750 health to both stats, leaving the base with a maximum of 81,900 Shield and 81,900 Hull health each. This level also adds one final floor to the base, giving it a maximum of 16 docking points, rounding out the symmetry of the base. This upgrade adds 4 [Capital Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets), 4 [Medium Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and one [Triple Capital Cannon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) at the top of the Starbase, and increases the explosion radius to 429. In addition, another hangar containing four [Starbase Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury) is added, leaving the **Starbase** with a grand total of 8 [Starbase Furies]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase-Fury) and 2 [Starhunters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starhunter) for defense. At this level, a **Starbase **is incredibly powerful, capable of fending off powerful siege fleets if all fighters are used.

## Making a Starbase Wealthy

Rich **Starbases** can keep up with the [Economy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Economy) and quickly level up. **Starbases** usually struggle to stay above 9000 base credits, so if your **Starbase** can consistently stay above this mark, it may be considered "rich". There are various ways to make a Starbase wealthy.

The recommended method is to set **Orange Restrictions** and to **Trade** a lot while there are no bosses, and when a boss spawns, use the **Combat Rewards** method below.

### Dumping Ore ( Mining )

This method is the slowest method but effective. It's required to do this method first in order to do a really fast method: **Trading.**

- If you do not know how to mine, see the [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) page.

<!-- -->

- When you have a full ore hold, dump your ore. <u>DO NOT SELL IT!</u> Selling the ore will only make the **Starbase** even more poor.
- The base will gain power. The more powerful your **Starbase** is, the more income it gains.
- You will also have ore in order to do the **Trading** method.

### Trading

This method has a player buy materials from a **Starbase** and then sell at another **Starbase** for the same or higher price. So the only base losing money is the one that bought the materials from the player.

The process of trading includes mining and dumping your ore. This method requires materials to be in your **Starbase** before following through. See the **Dumping Ore Method.**

- Open the [Economy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Economy) menu and look at the prices of materials of your **Starbase** and compare them to other **Starbases**, including the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). Choose a material to buy and a **Starbase** to sell at. You want the material you are buying to be cheaper at your **Starbase** than the **Starbase** you are planning on selling at. The **Starbase** also needs to have credits in order to pay you.

<!-- -->

- Spawn in a [Freighter]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), or any ship with high cargo hold.
- Buy the material or materials you chose from your **Starbase**, they will be loaded into your ship.
- Fly your ship to the **Starbase** you decided on.
- Sell the materials.

### Combat Rewards

This method is <u>very</u> effective. Just one attempt gets your starbase to level 4.

- Wait for a boss to spawn, that is anything that calls reinforcements when attacked. The most common ships are: [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher), [Decimator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Decimator), [Galleon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galleon), [Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kodiak), and [X-0]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}X-0)
- Spawn an agile [Frigate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) or a [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) and warp to the boss.
- Attack the boss until it either starts shooting back at you or you see the reinforcements start to warp to you.
- Once you have the boss's attention, warp to the **Starbase** that you wish to get rich. The boss should follow you as well as all of its reinforcements.
- Despawn your ship.
- Get a [Dragonfly]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dragonfly) or any ship that spawns in the **Starbase** and make sure the enemies are attacking you so they do not run away. Do not focus on doing damage, just dodge their fire.
- Let the **Starbase** kill the enemies and the **Starbase** receive the combat reward for killing the enemies. This will vary depending on how many ships it has killed.
- You can loot wreckages to get valuable loot. Especially boss ships, which will likely have [Plasma Batteries]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Plasma-Battery) or [Armor Scraps]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Armor-Scrap).

### Trade Restrictions

This [strategy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies) is common throughout the world of Galaxy, not to mention easy.

- This [strategy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies) may not make a **Starbase** rich, but it can help save money. The leader simply places selling restrictions on all of the [ore]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) while still allowing people to buy from the **Starbase**. This helps to stop [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) from coming and selling the base into bankruptcy. However, this will not stop miners from dumping [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores) at the **Starbase**.

### Loans

This [strategy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies) works exactly as it sounds: money loans.

- Simply making a loan to the base can help. This can be done by opening the menu once in the base and giving a loan. This gives 2.5k credits to the base - you cannot loan to a base with more than 8500 credits. These credits come from the player's own credits. After making a loan, the base will pay back very slowly until it pays the full amount, plus 10% interest, or 250 credits. The disadvantages of this [strategy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies) are that the player must stay online and in that faction for the loans to continue to pay back. If the **Starbase** is destroyed before the loan is paid back then the player will not continue to receive money. **Disconnecting is a large problem for people who make loans. Most players don't use this strategy because the Starbase could be destroyed, and you will lose all invested credits.**
