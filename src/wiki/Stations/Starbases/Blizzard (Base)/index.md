## Description

The **_Blizzard_** is a powerful [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) that looks identical to the [Blizzard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Blizzard) and was introduced in the Part 2 of [<span style="color:#aef2fe;text-shadow: 1px 1px 10px #aef2fe;">Christmas Event 2022</span>]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Christmas-Event-2022).

It is an extremely strong starbase, able to shred ships in minutes, but it's range is quite low and there is a massive weakness which is the blindspot behind the Blizzard, though keep in mind that it calls for support from other Pirate NPCs.

It instantly spawns in new Public Servers, but cannot respawn. It also cannot spawn in Private Servers.

It has a nuke radius of 8k Studs.

## Loot

The Blizzard Drops 1 [Frost Core]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frost-Core) and 40 [Ice Shard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ice-Shard).

## Version History

- Nuke Radius reduced from 50k to 8k in version .75a37
