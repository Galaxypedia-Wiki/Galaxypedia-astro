## Description

The [Military HQ]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Military-HQ) is a [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) that was added in from the [Galaxy Star Wars Event]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Star-Wars-Event) update. It held no purpose in the game and was just for decoration. It may be used in future updates. It has since been removed from the game, and therefore, cannot spawn. The [Military HQ]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Military-HQ) has the same amount of health as the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). If it could explode its explosive radius would be 100.

## Trivia

- The Military HQ closely resembles the Orbital Defense Platform from _Halo 2_:
