title: Remains of U.N.E Starbase 12
---

The **_Remains of U.N.E Starbase 12_** are a set of lore-based remains hidden in the map.

## Description

The **Remains of U.N.E Starbase 12** lie somewhere off center from the map, somewhat towards the top left. The structure has three destroyed ships associated with the U.N.E around it: a [Chimera]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Chimera), an [Orion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Orion), and a [Kneall Outrider]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens). The starbase largely resembles an old Level 1 Starbase, but it has a large crack across the roof, and terminals C and D are partly or completely destroyed. The Starbase does not appear as a select-able structure and has no menu or health GUI when entered. Ships also cannot dock, even at the relatively intact terminals.

## Interior

The only interactive part of the starbase is a small, non-quest dialogue hosted by the Starbase computer (adjacent to terminal C). The rest of the interior is covered in fires and rusted parts, as well as bodies of U.N.E soldiers in various levels of mutilation. One corner screen has a large condition red alert, and the other has a damaged U.N.E enlistment propaganda poster (the same one seen in the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) with a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Punisher) on it).
