The **Antares Comet** is a large object that was added in version .69f during the [Christmas 2020 Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}christmas-event-2020).

## Description

The **Antares Comet** is a large, icy blue comet. Although it does not move, it has a transparent tail, akin to a real comet. Near the underside of the comet, there is a [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion) frozen into the ice. The comet is considered to be an NPC [Starbase]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases), meaning it can be attacked, however it cannot be destroyed nor be captured by [Assimilation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Assimilations).

## Interior

The interior of the **Antares Comet** can be entered through a teleporter at the rear end of the comet. Once inside, the player finds themselves in a small, blue, rundown but detailed room that simply contains a computer with some dialogue. The actual purpose of this computer and the comet itself have yet to be discovered. The computer also speaks of the "Golem" from one of the terminals in Mega Base. It starts when you select the who has been here option while speaking to the computer.

## Trivia

- On the bottom left side of the **Antares Comet** there is a model of a [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion) stuck to it, which can't be accessed.
- The Antares comet crashed onto Aqueous, and previously offered a quest ship for 75 snowflakes and 150k credits.
- Despite its name, it is not related to the [Antares]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Antares), a Dreadnought from the [2019 Christmas Event]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}christmas-event-2019).
