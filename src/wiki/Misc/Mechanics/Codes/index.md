Currently, they are used to receive free ships or credits, mostly of lower classes or in small amounts. Currently, codes cannot be reused, so it would be recommended use them wisely.

## Codes

Both active and out-of-date codes will be listed here as they are created. So far, there are four codes. Code that expire or are disabled will be noted as so with a strike-through.

## Version History

- **??? (Please add previous related changes if possible)**
- Code "DELTA" added in version .76a11.

## Trivia

- The "SPACE" code used to award players the [Ibis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ibis), a Destroyer with a wide array of light turrets, but now rewards players with the [Zero]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zero).
- The first person to redeem the code "DELTA" was **lightflase**, which also earned the user an additional award of 100,000 credits as a bonus of being the first user to redeem it.
