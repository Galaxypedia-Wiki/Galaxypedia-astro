**Notice:** This page is missing images for visual representations and the in-game effects of **Shields**. Please add them when possible, and then remove this notice.

## Description

**_Shields_** are a secondary armor in Galaxy. **Shields** are designed to take damage before your [hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}hull) starts to be damaged. Every ship in Galaxy is equipped with varying levels of **Shield** health. Damage to **Shields** is based on the type of [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) used when damage is being dealt. Planets and starbases also have **Shield**, excluding the Planet [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad). Shields will slowly regenerate over time.

## Advantages

- [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Cannon, Flak, and Railgun]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) type turrets deal high damage to the [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) but deal low damage to **Shields** and travel slowly.
- **Shields** are able to regenerate in combat or undocked from a base, unlike [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull).

## Disadvantages

- **Shields** are weak to specific weapons. [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) travel quickly and deal high damage to **Shields** but deal low damage to hull. [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) do 70% of their damage to **Shields** and 100% to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) but require a longer time to reload and travel quite slowly. Speed always helps minimize damage to your **Shields** and ship overall. Keep in mind that the bigger your ship is, the more of a sitting duck you may be when your ship gets attacked by enemies.
- [Laser and PDL]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) turrets (more broadly called "Thermal" weaponry) also deal high damage to **Shields**, but low damage to [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull). As the size of the [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) increases, so does the damage dealt to **Shields**, with [Heavy Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) dealing whopping blows with a base damage of over 100 health each.
- **Shields** will fail when they are depleted, and then stay offline for 20 seconds; before they quickly regenerate to a partially full state. This leaves any ship with depleted shields very vulnerable to any form of kinetic weaponry for an extended period of time.

## Strategy

- Speed helps minimize physical damage to your ship. If you can outmaneuver the enemy ship or incoming fire with amazing dog-fighting skills, then you won't have to worry about your **Shields** or [Hull]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hull) too much.

## Version History

- (Please list all previous changes)
- Shields changed to have specific healing rates per [Ship]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) class while in combat (with the exception of [stealth ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}stealth-ships), which now no longer regenerate their shields outside of being docked), as well as now having the behavior of the shields failing when they are depleted, staying offline for 20 seconds before they regenerate quickly to a partially full state in version .76b28.
