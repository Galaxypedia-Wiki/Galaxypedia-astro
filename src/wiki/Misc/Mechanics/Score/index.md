_Not to be confused with [Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty)._

## Description

**_Score_** is the latest game mechanic to be added. Therefore, players with higher **Score** have done more of these things and tend to be more experienced than lower **Score** players. Keep in mind that this is not _always_ the case. **Score** saves, so when you leave and come back you will have the same **Score** as you had when you left. **Score**, unlike [Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty), cannot be lost, so there is no risk to your **Score** if you lose a ship.

## Trivia/Updates

**Score** is a good way to tell how much experience and play-time players have. You gain **Score** from killing [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens), [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining), [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading), killing [Fellow Players]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) and so on.
