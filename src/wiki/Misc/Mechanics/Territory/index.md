title: Territory
---

**_Territory_** is how much area a [faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) has (i.e. How far faction ships have ventured into space). You generally gain more **Territory** the higher your faction's power level, which is tied to the amount of ore in your base. The more ore there is, the faster the gain in power and territory. If you lose too much or have another faction completely take your faction's territory over, then you could possibly be [assimilated]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Assimilations) into another faction. **Territory** also influences which faction owns starbases and planets (at times the **Territory** between two or more factions will clash against each other). There is a non-assimilation area surrounding the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). Once 95% of **Territory** is conquered by one or more factions, the [endgame]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}endgame)Â begins. Territory will also show on the minimap.
