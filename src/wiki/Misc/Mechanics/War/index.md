## Main Info

**War** is a fundamental game mechanic of Galaxy, as progression in the game focuses mainly on obtaining warships, [Bounties]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty), and Items.

## Starting a War

When the leader of a faction declares war on another faction, there will be a 90-second period in-between the declaration of war and the commencement of the war itself. Additionally, any allies of the warred faction that are not also allied to the warring faction will also be automatically placed in the war. Factions that are allied to both will have their alliance with the warring faction automatically canceled.

Any factions that are not at war with the warring factions will not be affected by the war. Most wars often fall into either open conflict where neither side fights with a true goal, often engaging in small skirmishes, [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating), [Sieging]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging), or blockading the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) to cut off enemy trade. Any ships that are destroyed in a war will be lost permanently, and can only be regained through a player's own means.

### Wait time

In the 90 second time period of the war being initiated, players can neither engage ships of the opposing faction or the opposing faction's [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase). Leaders of both factions may agree to a peace request at any time during that 90 second period to immediately cancel the war. After 80 seconds, a 10-second warning notification will appear in the message bar alerting both factions that the war will begin imminently. When a war begins, players can engage enemy ships and Starbases in conflict.

## Advantages

You can earn a lot of credits from killing other ships for combat rewards. You can loot starbase's that you have killed, the loot can often be worth 100,000 credits.

### Restrictions

- Factions with a **level one** Starbase can only declare war on 1 factions at a time.
- Factions with a **level two** Starbase can only declare war on 2 factions at a time.
- Factions with a **level three** Starbase can only declare war on 3 factions at a time.
- Factions with a **level four** Starbase can only declare war on 4 factions at a time.

## Ending a War

In order to cease an ongoing war, both sides must agree to peace. However, it is not possible to stop a war during the endgame when three or fewer factions remain. All newly declared wars will be permanent until the server resets from a win condition.
