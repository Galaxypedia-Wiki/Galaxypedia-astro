## Description

The **Warehouse** is where all materials for building ships are stored. Ships can be built at any outpost, but can only be built using materials in the **Warehouse**. Though the contents of the **Warehouse** can be seen in any location, ores can only be added to or removed from the **Warehouse** while players are inside of the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). Materials can be put in the **Warehouse** by either:

**A)** Directly buying them from the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) into your **Warehouse**.

_or_

**B)** Using a trade ship to transport materials from your home base or wrecks to the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) and transferring the items directly from the ship to your **Warehouse**.

Once the correct amount of [Materials]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Materials) is in the **Warehouse**, ships can be purchased, as long as you can also pay the up-front manufacturing fee.

**Warehouses** are upgradeable, with each level increasing the total storage available in your **Warehouse** as shown in the table below.

- [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) require a level 8-15 Warehouse to create.
- [Carriers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) require a level 9-21 **Warehouse**.
- [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) require a level 4-16 level **Warehouse**.

The New Player Protection in Galaxy is directly dependent on **Warehouse** levels. A player is titled as a "New Player" if they have a level **one** **Warehouse**. If a player has this protection, you cannot attack any of their [Miner]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) or [Freighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters)-class ships. Once a "New Player's" **Warehouse** is upgraded to level **two**, _all_ of their ships become vulnerable to player attacks. The warehouse automatically upgrades once a certain number of credits is reached, saying that, "Congratulations! You are no longer a new player!" upon rejoining.

Prior to the **Warehouse** update, ships were built using materials deposited in your own Starbase. All of the ore that [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) brought in were stored in a base's "Cargo hold," as it were. It was almost impossible to get a [Dreadnought]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) unless you locked a faction and played for 3+ hours in order to collect that much ore uninterrupted, not to mention the considerable manufacturing cost of making such large ships back then. Because ores were not purchased, players essentially had to pay the full price in their own credits in one straight purchase, rather than the way **Warehouses** let players _gradually_ collect and pay for ore for ships.

Players can only have up to 150,000 of any ore in their warehouse; if the player places more ore in their warehouse, the game will remove it upon joining a new server. This ore is likely lost and will not be sold for any compensation, so players should avoid gathering too much ore at once.

## Trivia

- The **Warehouse** costs $5,093,500 [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) to max out.
- It is assumed that the **Warehouse** was created to stop players from stealing other players' hard earned [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores)
- In update version .53d, the **Warehouse** received a massive nerf.
- In .64f, the **Warehouse** received a buff, lower level **Warehouses** became cheaper, and higher level **Warehouses** got a small size buff.
- In update .72b, **[Rcouret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rcouret)** announced **Warehouse** upgrade cap to level 40 when super-capital build-menu introduced, however the current max is level 38.
