The **Build Menu** _(BM)_ is one of Galaxy's core functions, thats purpose is to act as a menu for building most of the ships in the game, other than [Quests]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quests).

## Interface

![The Build Menu.]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}BuildMenu3.png-"The-Build-Menu.") The Build Menu is an interface that lists every ship that is able to be built under a list of ship types and sorts these ship types from the topmost being the weakest ship types, such as economical ship types and [Frigates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}frigates), to the strongest ship type available on the bottom, which are [Super Capital Ships.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) Inside one of every ship type boxes are the listed ships that are available to build from that ship type.

Once you click on a ship, it will show you most of its stats, its description, and how much materials it needs to be built.

**Build and Material costs of ships are sorted from the cheapest ships being on-top of the list, and the most expensive ships of a ship type being on the bottom of the list.**

## Limited Ships

[Limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) Ships are a special type of ships that are usually much more powerful, expensive and rare and are usually acquired from [Quests]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quests) in [Events]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}events), but many Limited Ships are also able to be built, both in the Build Menu, and the **Limited Build Menu**.

The "Limited Build Menu" no longer requires permits. It now requires 5x the material cost in Manufacturing Fee (or 250k for small ships) and only allows you to build ships you previously had. For balancing reasons, this only tracks as of this update, so ships you've lost previously are not available.

Previously, the Limited Build Menu required specific permits however this was changed in version .xxxx (tbd)
