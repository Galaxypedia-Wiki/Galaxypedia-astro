_Not to be confused with [Score]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Score)._

## Overview

**_Bounty_** is a mechanic similar to [Score]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Score) that is purely based on the amount and types of ships you destroy. **Bounty** is earned by destroying other player's ships. (Not including the [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp) or [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm)). The amount of **Bounty** awarded per ship destroyed appears to be a function of the cost of the destroyed ship. **Bounty** is lost if your own ship is destroyed, and many players find it difficult to get **Bounty** and keep it. If a starbase (or a NPC ship) destroys your ship, you will keep your bounty. Not having **Bounty** doesn't make you a bad or inexperienced player, as many very strong and experienced players simply don't actively hunt for it. If you kill players that have **Bounty**, you won't be given **Bounty** but instead will take their **Bounty** as credits. The record for the highest bounty ever is Speci1374 (Previously known as Axxuri) with more than 13 Million. Speci1374 no longer has that because rcouret reset everyone's bounty in late August 2020. As of the current version, the rate of bounty to material values of ship is 1:5. 1 bounty for every 5 material cost credit.

## Gaining Bounty

To gain **Bounty**, you must destroy a ship owned by a player with no **Bounty**. Destroying [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) or a [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) is the best way to do this. Many players do this through a method called [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating).

## Bounty Hunting

[Bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Bounty) hunters are players who hunt other players for their bounty (hence the name). Bounty hunters are sometimes confused with [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) due to the fact that they may kill anybody else with a good enough bounty. Another reason why bounty hunters are also seen as pirates is their ship choice. Many bounty hunters will use small fast ships that holds a variety of guns to take down the ships quickly without having the reinforcements arrive before the ship is destroyed. Pirate ship choices are very similar to bounty hunter ship choices. [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) like these include the [Gideon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gideon), [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra), and the [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold). Bounty hunters typically have large amounts of bounty themselves and many are skilled pilots.
