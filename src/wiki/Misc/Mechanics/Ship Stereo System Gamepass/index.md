## Description

The **Ship Stereo System Gamepass** is a retired Gamepass that is no longer obtainable. If you own the Gamepass and have a ship spawned you can use the /music [command]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Commands) to play any song (Must be a Roblox Song ID) with your ship as the audio source.

## Features

The **Ship Stereo System Gamepass** is a now retired gamepass that costed 2500 Robux. In addition to being able to play Roblox song IDs in-game using the /music [command]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Commands), players who own the Gamepass will receive the [STEREO] chat tag in-game, and the Stereo role on the Galaxy Discord (after proper verification). if the player also has the [VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass), the in-game chat tag will be [VIP|STEREO] instead.

## Trivia

Dev Advisors, Admins, Developers, [Yname]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Yname) and [Rcouret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Rcouret) have the ability to use the /music [command]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Commands) without owning the **Ship Stereo System Gamepass**.
