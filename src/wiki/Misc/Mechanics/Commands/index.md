**Commands** are specific codes/words used to execute a function within the game. They can be used to display statistics or lists, play music, or change servers. The default command tag in Galaxy is /. For example, to see your own logs you would type /log into the chat. This page only displays commands that are usable by every player, not restricted commands.
