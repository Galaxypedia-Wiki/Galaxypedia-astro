## Description

**Factions** are one of the major aspects of the game. When you first join Galaxy, you are greeted with a menu to create or join a**faction**. The player who creates the**faction** will get to pick the colour and name. There is a maximum of nine **factions** per server (Five for [Galaxy Arcade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Arcade)) and  **factions**cannot be created during [Endgame]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Endgame). **Factions** are able to war each other or ally with each other. Each **faction** comes with its own [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase). If all [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) that**faction** owns are destroyed, it is defeated and that team is removed.

## Leaders

The player who creates the **faction** is the leader. This gives them permissions to upgrade their [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase)(s), declare [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), make peace, and propose [Alliances]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Alliances), as well as other **faction** management options. After the leader leaves the game or **faction**, another player is selected leader at random, or the leader can appoint someone else as the leader to take their place.

## Base Credits

[Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) need [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits) to be able to buy materials and be upgraded, they are generated automatically from negative taxes or the base's own income, which is earned from territory. A base can reach negative credits if people dump enough [Ores]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ores).![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Create-a-faction.JPG-"Create-a-faction.JPG"){width="239" height="239"} ![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Join-a-faction.JPG-"Join-a-faction.JPG"){width="220" height="220"}![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}FreedomBaseWouldBeMad.png-"FreedomBaseWouldBeMad.png"){width="245" height="245"}
