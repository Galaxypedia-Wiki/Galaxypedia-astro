## Description

The **_Hull_** is "the main body of a ship or other vessel, including the bottom, sides, and deck of the ship, but not including the masts, superstructure, rigging, engines, and other fittings on the ship". In Roblox Galaxy, **Hull** is the armor integrity of a ship that is calculated through materials used, ship class, and armour shape/form.

## Advantages of Hull

The **Hull** is the primary armour and exterior of a ship. **Hull** is calculated by what class the ship is, what materials are used, and the shape/form of the armour. The Hull (or ship armour) can resist damage from incoming [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and any [Shield Damaging Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). Hull tanks can be useful in [sieges]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sieging), as [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) have mainly shield-based turrets.

## Disadvantages of Hull

While the **Hull** is the primary armour of a ship, It's better to retreat when your [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) are down, or before your hull hits critical levels. The Hull takes more damage from incoming [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Hull Damaging Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets). Unless you're sure you can take on an enemy ship while currently at low **Hull** and no [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), it's better to get your health back up before fighting again. Hull is less useful than shields in most cases, as many ships are hull breakers and hull does not regenerate slowly away from safety like [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields). It also regenerates slower when docked than [shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}shields).

## Overall

In short, having a ship with strong **Hull** health can help you survive battles longer. With more disadvantages than advantages, it's better to compensate low ship health with good pvp skills and evasive reflexes to survive longer in combat.
