**Damage Resistance** is a property of [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) and [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) affecting how much damage Turrets and Spinals do relative to their base damage stats.

## Description

Damage resistance varies with a [Ship's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) class and changes the amount of damage a ship receives from a given source.

For example, suppose a [Battlecruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) had 2500 [Shield]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields) and it was hit by a [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) with a base damage of 125. The true damage the ship would take would be reduced by the percent relative to the ship's class, in this case, Battlecruiser. If Battlecruisers had a base damage resistance of 0-5%, the ship would take a maximum of 125 damage (0% reduction) or a minimum of 118.75 (5% reduction; 125 - 5% of 125 = 118.75).

Damage resistance values were updated in version .70. Most ships saw increases in resistance. Miner/Freighter resistance was increased from 10 to 15%; Frigate resistance was increased from 20% to 25%; Dreadnought resistance was increased from 35% to 38%; Super Capital resistance was increased from 35% to 42%; Alien resistance was decreased from 30% to 25%. Additionally, Starbase resistance was decreased from 50% to 45%.

It was further altered in .71c.

Damage Resistance was removed in .76b26, and all affected ships' hull and shield values were increased proportionately to their prior resistance.

Some ships are able to temporarily apply damage resistance to themselves or others through the use of a [module]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Modules).
