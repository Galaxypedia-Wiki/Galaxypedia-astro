## Introduction

This page is a comprehensive list and description of all **Ship Modules** in the game. Before diving into the list, they will first be explained.

### What Are Ship Modules?

**Ship Modules** are unique, active systems on a [ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}ships) that can be activated using the **[B]** key. If your ship has a module, you will see a blue button that looks like this: ![The UI button for a module, if equipped on your
ship.](ModuleButton.png "The UI button for a module, if equipped on your ship.") Each module typically has own custom and/or unique effect that can benefit you and/or your team when used well in combat, however you need to be mindful about when you use them; as modules have cool-downs. Modules can be **Abilities**, which trigger some special event immediately, or **Toggles**, which changes the state of a specific ship or structure for an indefinite amount of time. Abilities have an **Effect Time**, which determines how long they are in effect, be it for a few seconds, a few minutes, or instantly. Both types of modules have a **Cooldown**, the time that must pass before the module can be used again after being deactivated.

## Overview

Ship Module Name Effect Type Effect Time Cooldown Time

---

[Snowfall]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Snowfall) Cryogenic Counter Reduces the max speed of all enemy ships in a 6k stud area by 50%, and reduces their turnspeed by 50%. This effect lasts for 20 seconds, and persists even if enemies leave the 6k range. Ability 20s 65s [Theseus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus) Hull Booster Heals 1.5k hull hp over the course of 20(?) seconds. If the module repaired the ship's hull completely then any remaining repairs would be overflowed to repairing the shield. Ability Unknown 30s [Theseus-U]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-U) Hull Booster Same as Theseus. Ability Unknown 30s [Theseus-E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-E) Hull Booster Same as Theseus. Ability Unknown 30s [Theseus-K]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-K) Hull Booster Same as Theseus. Ability Unknown 30s [Theseus-X]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theseus-X) Hull Booster Same as Theseus, although the module heals 4.5k, with double the cooldown time. Ability Unknown 60s [Apogee]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apogee) Homing Missiles Fires 6 homing missiles on the selected target, which will chase it down until they have traveled 5k studs. If this limit is exceeded, the missiles will stop tracking the target, travel a bit more and, if they fail to contact anything, they simply disappear. Must be within 5k studs of an enemy to use. Ability Instant 15s [Odyssey]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Odyssey) Injector Burn The Odyssey has a unique mechanic in that it has a "fuel" meter. When not in use, the ship regenerates fuel at around 5 units per second. When the module is activated, the ship instantly accelerates to 3 times its max speed, and starts eating up fuel at a rate of ~10 units per second. The ship is unable to change velocity, and turnspeed is drastically reduced. The module can be deactivated after 3 seconds. It automatically deactivates when the ship runs out of fuel, causing it to instantly return to its default top speed. The ship can have 150 fuel at most at any given time. Toggle 15s (max) 3s [Deity]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Deity) Adaptive Thrusters Reduces the turn speed of the ship but increases its top speed to 160 studs per second. Re-using the module switches the ship back to its original properties. This can be used to slow the ship down to 60 studs per second instantaneously. Toggle Unlimited 5s [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion) Commanding Presence Can only be activated while within 8k studs of an enemy base, and deactivates if the ship leaves this area. Spawns an orange shield that resembles a [ShieldSide]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}ShieldSide) between the ship and the target base. All turrets on the base lock on to the Hyperion regardless of LoS or range. However, those that are unable to hit the ship (due to the aforementioned reasons) will not shoot. Additionally, the ship gains 65% damage resistance from the base and 15%(?) from all other sources. Additionally, the ship gains a 1.1x damage multiplier and a greater increase to damage resistance from outside sources when in the [Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold) environment. The module never deactivates unless the Hyperion leaves the 8k range. Upon doing so, the 90s cooldown timer will start. Must be within 8k of an enemy to use. Toggle Unlimited 90s [Subjugator]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Subjugator) Shield Bulwark Gives all allied ships within a 6k(?) stud area 35% shield damage resistance, and gives 15% to itself. Ability Unknown Unknown [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia) Spinal Array Fires a very large barrage of spinals, consisting of 8 huge [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry) and [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry). Ability 8s 20s [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus) Targeting Supercomputer Boosts accuracy of all allied ships (including itself) in a 5k(?) stud area by 20% for some time. Ability Unknown Unknown [Oblivion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Oblivion) Blink Drive Teleports the ship 2,000 studs in the direction of the the cursor, while maintaining velocity. Ability Instant 15s [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer) Quantum Wave Deals 800 damage to all enemy ships in a 4k stud area. Ability Instant 15s [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1) Bastion Mode Reduces the max speed of the ship severely, but increases damage output (+20%) and 35% of damage from all sources is negated. All neons on the ship become red. Using the module switches the ship in and out of Bastion Mode. While in this state, the ship is unable to warp. Toggle Unlimited 45s [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2) Kneall Munitions Converts all weaponry to plasma-type. All weaponry deals 90% damage to both shield and hull. Ability 15s 30s [Festive Kodiak]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Festive-Kodiak) Pirate Salvage Spawns two random player or U.N.E. ships that have previously died in the round, but on the Pirate faction at the Kodiak. Fighters are excluded, and carriers cannot use fighters. Ships spawned by this cannot use modules. These ships remain spawned until destroyed, and can be called to the Festive Kodiak's aid. Ability Instant 300s

## Detailed List of Modules

Modules will be described in the following format: Module Name (title), Module Description (description of what module does, supported by a demonstration shown within video or image media, ideally), Module Effect Duration (if applicable), Module Effect Range (again, if applicable), Module Cool-down.

### Kneall Munitions

**Kneall Munitions** is a module exclusive and unique to the [Prototype X-2]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-2), capable of greatly increasing the damage output of its weaponry. When activated, all of the ship's weapons deal damage identical to as if they were on an [Alien]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}alien-ships-and-stations)-class ship (90% to Shield, 90% to Hull), overall increasing damage output of all weapons, and changes the color of all projectiles from the weapons to the green projectile color seen from alien-class ships. Here is a video of the module in action against the planet [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad), shown below: ![Example
of "Kneall Munitions" against
Myriad.](Prototype-X-2_ActiveModule.mov "Example of "Kneall Munitions" against Myriad.") The effect of the module, once activated, lasts for exactly 15 seconds; before going on cool-down for 30 seconds.

### Spinal Array

**Spinal Array** is the [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia)'s unique module, primarily used as a burst-damage weapon system. When activated, the ship will begin to emit particles out of its central exhaust ports for a few moments and open armored shutters on the bow covering a spinal array, before firing a huge spinal burst of [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry#Phasers), quickly followed by [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry#Cannons). Note that **unlike [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry), you cannot aim this weapon system with your mouse cursor.** A video below shows the module in action: ![Example of "Spinal
Array".](Theia_ActiveModule.mov "Example of "Spinal Array".") The module is active for 8 seconds, before going on cool-down for 20 seconds.

### Quantum Wave

**Quantum Wave** is the [Lucifer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lucifer)'s exclusive and unique module, used for defense against swarms of small ships. When activated, there will be a brief micro-explosion generated by the ship, before causing a explosion with a radius of 4000 studs. Here's a video showing the module in action below: ![Example of
"Smartbomb".](Lucifer_ActiveModule.mov "Example of "Smartbomb".") The module goes on cool-down after the fairly quick large explosion for 15 seconds.

### Blink Drive

**Blink Drive** is the [Oblivion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Oblivion)'s unique module that is a movement-focused active system. Upon activation, the ship will instantly teleport a constant, but short distance towards the cursor; leaving behind an afterimage, which can be useful for confusing your enemies (and potentially [AI Fighters]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}AI-Fighters)), quickly getting out of the way of [Torpedoes]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinal-Weaponry#Torpedoes), or for quickly getting into a blind-spot of an enemy capital ship at close range. One notable limitation of the module is that you cannot teleport into objects (i.e. other ships, [bases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases), or [planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets)), and will give an error message in the chat like this: ![The error message that appears if you attempt
to "Blink" into an
object.](BlinkRestriction.png "The error message that appears if you attempt to "Blink" into an object.") Here is a video of the module in action below: ![Example of "Blink
Drive."](Oblivion_ActiveModule.mov "Example of "Blink Drive."") The module goes on cool-down for 15 seconds after being used.

### Adaptive Thrusters

**Adaptive Thrusters** is the [Deity]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Deity)'s unique movement-type module. The module acts as a toggle between two movement modes for the ship, a high speed mode that allows the ship to reach an outrageous top speed of 150, while having sluggish turning; and the normal mode with 60 top speed and much better turning. A video showing the module in action is shown below: ![An example of "Adaptive
Thrusters".](Deity_ActiveModule.mov "An example of "Adaptive Thrusters".") The cool-down for switching between movement modes with the module is 5 seconds.

### Bastion Module

**Bastion Module** is a defense-type module unique and exclusive to the [Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prototype-X-1). Upon activation, the ship's neon lights become dark, then glow a red color very similar to that of the [Cyber Prototype X-1]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cyber-Prototype-X-1); along with increasing the accuracy of all the turrets and giving the ship temporary damage resistance. The major downsides though, are that the ship becomes extremely slow (**has only a top speed of 2**), and cannot warp for the duration of the effect of the module; meaning you must be careful about when you choose to use the module. Additionally, when the module's effect is about to dissipate, the ship's neon lighting will begin to slowly flash (about twice), before going back to the normal white color along with the module going on cool-down. Here is a video of the module in action against a Level 5 [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase): ![An
example of "Bastion Module" against a Level 5
Starbase.](Prototype-X-1_ActiveModule.mov "An example of "Bastion Module" against a Level 5 Starbase.")

### Targeting Supercomputer

**Targeting Supercomputer** is a module exclusive to the [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus), useful for countering fast-moving ships or for improving the accuracy of long-range ships such as the [Judgement]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Judgement). When activated, it gives all allies within 5,000 studs a +75% turret accuracy boost. Once activated, the module will run for 30 seconds then enter a cooldown period of 45 seconds. The module's effects are also applied onto the [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus) who is using the module, resulting in devastating accuracy. In testing, the [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus) was able to consistently hit full vollies on a [Sovereign]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sovereign) from 4,500 studs away. This module is most powerful when used while diving bases, as it allows the [Astraeus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Astraeus) and any other supporting ships to stay 5-7k studs away from a base (outside of the range of the high-dps turret batteries on bases), while also having good enough accuracy to hit [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) and even some [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers).
