title: Loyalty
---

**_Loyalty_** affects the amount of damage that you do. The time needed to gain a certain **Loyalty** can be calculated with the following formula:

y=45x(x-1)-20

X = the amount of **Loyalty**

Y = the time needed to reach "x" **Loyalty** (in seconds)

![Loyalty
display|link=<https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/File:Loyalty.png>](Loyalty.png "Loyalty display|link=https://roblox-galaxy-official.fandom.com/wiki/File:Loyalty.png")With the [Galaxy VIP Gamepass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-VIP-Gamepass), you start with 3% **Loyalty**. Loyalty Boost also takes effect. During [Endgame]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Endgame), Loyalty is gained 150% faster, meaning each level takes 2/3^rds^ as long to reach. Being in combat may also affect loyalty gain, but such information is unverified.

**Loyalty** saves even when you leave, as long as you join the same faction as before.

Either the formula above is incorrect or the loyalty gain in a vip server is different, as testing was done and the times are incorrect.

# Trivia

- It would take approximately **5 days, 3 hours, 44 minutes, 40 seconds** to reach a Loyalty of 100% (without endgame) before the cap was added.
- As of version .64e, **Loyalty** was capped at 30%. New records can't be set anymore. This cap was raised to 33% in version .71c.
- It would take approximately**13 hours, 11 minutes, 40 seconds** to reach a maximum Loyalty of 33%  without endgame.
- As of version .61h, **Loyalty** increases **25% faster** than before.
- As of version .68a, **Loyalty** and Starbase level requirements to spawn certain ships have been lowered.
- The "Loyalty Saving Update" was done in response to the then-famous "GUI glitch," which made it impossible to interact with any [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or ship GUI screens, rendering the game nearly unplayable for those that it befell. The only known way to fix it was to rejoin the game, which previously meant all **Loyalty** was lost. This glitch has now been patched.
- Loyalty is no longer a ship spawning requirement .76c1
- Loyalty no longer effects mining and you now mine at the equivalent at 15% loyalty at all times .76e7
