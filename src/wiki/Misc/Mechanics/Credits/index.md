**Credits** are the main currency in Galaxy. They are used to manufacture or purchase [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships), buy [Materials]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Materials), upgrade a player's [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse), complete [Quests]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Quests), upgrade or loan to [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase), and more.

Typically, people earn credits by [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) or [Trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading). However, some more experienced players [Pirate]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) to earn credits.

### Buying Credits

As an alternative to the normal methods, Credits may be purchased using [ROBUX]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}w:c:roblox:Robux). Buying credits helps support Galaxy. ![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}RobuxForCredits.png-"RobuxForCredits.png"){width="500"}
