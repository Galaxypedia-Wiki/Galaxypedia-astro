**_Endgame_** _is the final phase in a round of Galaxy. This is not the same as a "Final Round."_

## Description

**Endgame** is a period in Galaxy gameplay during which [Factions]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) cannot be created. Additionally, a faction can win that round of Galaxy by either eliminating all other factions or by taking over 90% of the territory. **Endgame** does not begin until a total of 95% of open space has been converted into all factions' territories, including NPC factions. If **Endgame** is active, red colored words will appear above the map displaying "ENDGAME ACTIVE." Some players think that during **Endgame**everyone is supposed to go to war, but that isn't always the case.

Additionally, **Endgame** increases the capital ship counts per faction from three [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) to four and from four [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) to five. The [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) and [Super-Capital]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships) counts remain the same (one). Another effect of **Endgame** is that faction leaders cannot kick players in their [faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions) and no new [alliances]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}alliances) can be created. [Loyalty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalty) will also increase at a boosted rate while **Endgame** is active.

## Trivia

- While **Endgame**simply resets the server upon a faction's victory, the similarly colored "Final Round" warning will shut down a Galaxy server when the server is abandoned or after a faction wins.
- If only one player faction exists on a server when **Endgame** conditions are met (95% map territory is occupied), then the server will declare whichever faction (player or NPC) has more territory the winner of the round and will initiate a reset.
- If you hold anything in your cargo while the round reset it will automatically sell
