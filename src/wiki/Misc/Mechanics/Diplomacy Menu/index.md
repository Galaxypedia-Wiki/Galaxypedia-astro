## Description

The **Diplomacy Menu** displays information about every player [Faction]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Factions). It shows the leader of each faction, which factions are at [war]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}war) with each other, and which factions are allied with each other. Each tab is colored according to the faction team color, and factions can be selected by clicking on their respective tabs on the left side of the menu. If factions are not at war or allied, the menu will simply remain blank. A faction that has declared war but has not yet started the war (due to the 90-second timer) will have "(pending)" marked next to the warring factions' names. ![centre|thumb|354x354px]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Diplomacy-menu.JPG-"centre|thumb|354x354px")
