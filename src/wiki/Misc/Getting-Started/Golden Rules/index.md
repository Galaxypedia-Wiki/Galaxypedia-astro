_These are not exactly rules, but tips that players may want to consider. Based off of the tips in [Ship Loss]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ship-Loss)._

### <u>Be able to afford a loss</u>

- Never fly a ship (especially with cargo inside) you can't afford to lose during war unless you know how to deal with dangerous situations such as being dived by a powerful ship. Always check the minimap for signs of enemy ships and be more cautious when using limited ships.
- You should know when it is a good or a bad time to fly your ship for any reason. For example, if you are at war with a faction that is likely to pirate, do not mine or trade in expensive ships unless you feel certain you can escape if you're dived.

### <u>Never [Mine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) during a war</u>

- Do not **Mine** during a war, many miners have lost their ships to [Pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}pirating) because of this. Not even if you need a quick credit boost. It's very easy to lose even the tankiest of [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships) when at war with a powerful faction. If you are mining during war, make sure to check the map often for enemies and warp back to your base if even one ship spawns and points towards you. If you are quick enough it is easy to avoid destruction, but always be careful, and preferably don't mine during war in the first place.

### <u>Never [Trade]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) during a war</u>

- This is the equivalent to mining during a war. Never **Trade** during a war with a larger or more experienced faction, as many [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) will likely be around where you wish to loot or sell your loot. An exception is when using extremely cheap [Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) such as the [Tempura]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempura) or [Prospector]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prospector), but any loot you collected will be lost unless you manage to loot your own wreck.
- This is a common strategy for [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) to gain [credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}credits)/[bounty]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}bounty). As pirates can return to your wreck with a freighter of their own and an escort to loot whatever was in your cargo hold. In some cases they may not need to change ships since pirate ships like the [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios) usually have a high cargo hold.
- Freighter pirating usually happens around [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). A ship such as the Nightmare can even spawn at Mega Base immediately for a surprise attack, usually leading to ship destruction.

### <u>Avoid going to [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) if you're at [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War), as [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) normally attack there</u>

- **Pirates** can camp at **Mega Base** to attack unsuspecting ships that come there.
- If you are aware that **Pirates** in your current server travel to **Mega Base** often, be careful.
- Some factions may also choose to blockade **Mega Base**, to prevent opposing ships from fleeing.
- To reduce your chances of being a victim to **Pirates**, remember to check the minimap often, especially when you are going to **Mega Base** or have a lot of loot/cargo.

### <u>Constantly check your [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap) to see where [pirates]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}pirating) or [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) may be</u>

- The **Minimap** is there to assist you, use it to your advantage. Look for enemies of any kind and learn to estimate distances based on where objects are in relation to each other. This can be extremely important for warping properly to things you can't see or looking for danger.

### <u>Experience matters!</u>

- You're in this game for the long run. Don't expect to do anything meaningful on the first day playing, or ever.
- Don't let [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts) or other big ships overwhelm you, as most can be destroyed easily using an experienced fleet.
- Take your time learning about the game and asking for help from other players, knowledge of the game is very important for playing.
- Always know which ships you're dealing with. Know which ones are slow, fast, hull tanks, shield tanks, have high or low DPS, etc.
- There will always be a bigger fish, someone who is more skilled, richer, or more connected than you. You may not be the best, but you can be your best.

### <u>Bigger is not always better</u>

- More expensive ships are not always better ships, they may also make a bigger target.
- Better ships can usually cost many times more than a slightly worse ship. Choose wisely.
- Ships of all sizes have functions to which they are well-suited. For example, small ships may be fast and agile whereas larger ships may be slower and easier to hit.
- With enough skill and experience, ship size & class really doesn't matter all that much.

### <u>Unfair circumstances?</u>

- There are no fair or unfair fights, the outcome of any fight usually depends entirely on skill and ship choice. The only exception is fights disrupted by normally impossible circumstances or severe lag.
- Just because you *can* fly something doesn't mean you *should*.
- The only exception to "an unfair fight" would be if you are glitched or getting targeted by an exploiter, both of which scenarios you should contact [Galaxy Staff]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Galaxy-Staff) about.
- Always expect every possibility, from an enemy spawning a dangerous ship to a 1v1 being completely changed by other players joining the fight.

### <u>You **_will_** lose ships, don't worry!</u>

- If you do PvP long enough, you *will* lose your ship. It's only a matter of where and when and which (as in which ship).
- If you leave the game while your ship is still spawned, your ship will remain in space for 2 minutes to which it will then despawn. This timer is stopped if you rejoin within a minute of when you left.
- Somebody, somewhere has better skill than you, more experience than you, is more clever than you, and can stay online longer than you.
- At some point, everyone will lose one of their beloved ships. No matter how skilled and clever you are, it happens to everyone, and that's okay.
- If you lose a ship, don't take your frustration out on the player that killed you, as destroying others ships are a part of the game, if not the point of the game. Instead focus your attention on rebuying the ship or choosing a better ship that may be a better option to use.
- If you lose ships, usually it is your fault. You may have warped slightly too short or too far, or you may have missed your spinals too many times. Don't worry about this, since it's too late already. Instead accept the loss and move on as quickly as possible.
- Avoid raging or lashing out against other players if you do lose your ship. Acting out your frustration will only dig you into a deeper hole, and possibly end in you being banned. Take a deep breath, calm down, and move on.

### <u>Practice with [Warping]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warp-Drive)!</u>

- Remember you have 120 seconds between when [War]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) is declared and when you can be attacked.
- Use that time to get to an allied [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) and despawn, if you're in a non-combat ship.
- Perfect warping is important! It can save your ship in many situations. For example, docking at the nearest friendly base to despawn when being attacked. Overwarping or underwarping can give your enemy plenty of time to finish you off.
