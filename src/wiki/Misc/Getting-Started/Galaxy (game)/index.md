![]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Game-Banner.png-"Game-Banner.png") This page serves as an introduction/overview of the overall subject matter the Galaxypedia covers with its pages, which is the Roblox game [Galaxy](https://www.roblox.com/games/12426862174/).

## Introduction

**Galaxy**, created by [rcouret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}rcouret), is a team-based game focused on space combat and exploration, revolving around the primary goal of having your faction win the round by controlling the vast majority of all territory on the map, or eliminating all other factions during Endgame. However, that is not all there is to it. There is a vast selection of [ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) you are able to obtain/build, starting with [Miners]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}mining-ships)/[Freighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}freighters) for gathering resources as well as trading, all the way up to [Super Capitals]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}super-capital-ships), which serve as powerful fleet flagships. Whatever playstyle someone prefers, such as [pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Strategies#Pirating), reconnaissance, tank, or other kinds of playstyles, there is a ship for that. There is also a variety of [planets]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}planets) and [bases]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}starbases) to explore, such as [Frion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Frion) and the [Derelict Station]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Derelict-Station), which contain quite a few secrets and easter eggs in their intricate landscapes/layouts; in addition to there being many [quests]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}quests) to complete and earn rewards from often being located at such planets and bases. On occasion every year, there are typically limited-time [events]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}events) that are released, offering new or old [limited]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}limited-ships) ships, and sometimes new areas and/or experiences to explore.

## Gameplay

### Beginning

In **Galaxy**, new players start off with a starter ship, AKA a [Wasp]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wasp), a free beginner mining ship (there is also the [Wyrm]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Wyrm), a free beginner freighter) to begin their journey. There is also a [tutorial]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tutorial) that can be completed if any new player chooses to do so (it is highly recommended to play the tutorial), which gives a prize for completing it. New players generally first start gathering resources (possibly trading a little afterwards for earning [Credits]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Credits)) while on the [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E) team (a team protected from [war]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}War) and [assimilation]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Assimilations)) in order to build larger, and better ships (but more importantly, better miners), as well as upgrade their [Warehouse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Warehouse). Eventually, due to heavy restrictions on the class and capabilities of ship that players are able to use on the team, they will join or create a faction, where they are able to use ships of all kinds and have their own bases. In short, starting as a new player is mainly about building some capital, in the form of ships, credits, and/or materials.

### General

When a round starts, there will be a new map with randomly generated NPC-controlled bases/planets (e.g. [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership), [Freedom Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Freedom-Base), [Myriad]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Myriad)), however the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) and the [U.N.E]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E)'s base are always present. Many factions are typically created by players, starting out with level 1 [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) as their sole base, and work to gain [Territory]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Territory), in order to increase the income of their bases, and protect themselves from assimilation. AI-controlled enemy ships spawn at certain intervals, such as [Aliens]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) and [Pirates]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}pirate-ships), the former of which can attack bases. These ships drop loot, which is oftentimes valuable for earning credits, completing quests, or for use as materials in building ships. Outside of all this, players can explore space around them, and form a functioning [economy]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Economy) where [trading]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Trading) is frequent, and [mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining) constant.

As a general rule, rounds eventually end in any of the following ways:

- One faction owns the vast majority of all territory on the map, winning the round.
- The [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) is destroyed by enemy ships (this results in the server shutting down).
- There is only one faction remaining during Endgame, winning the round.

### [Endgame]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Endgame)

As implied by the name, it is when a round is in its terminal stages of gameplay, where no more new factions can be created. When this state is active, rounds typically (though oftentimes, not always) end within a relatively short period of time afterwards. For more information, please see the page linked in the header.

### Exploration

Exploration is oftentimes a refresher from the combat of war-torn rounds, or the process of gaining capital through mining, trading, etc. Outside of exploring planets and bases, players can explore space itself, and find points of interest such as the [U.N.E Battle of Sector 552 Wreckage]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E-Battle-of-Sector-552-Wreckage), [U.N.E Starbase 12]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}U.N.E-Starbase-12), and more. Generally, it is a good idea to explore some place if you find mining/trading getting stagnant, or need some way to spend your downtime you need for repairing your ship after combat; even if you have already explored that place before. You might just find something new, or come to appreciate the little details of whatever landscape you're on when at a planet. Additionally, exploration is very useful for finding [quest]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}quests) vendors (NPCs which give quests), many of which are hidden in various places.
