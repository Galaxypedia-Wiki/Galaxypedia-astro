## Ship to ship combat

This section compiles a list of general combat strategies in PvP. See the second dropdown menu for more in-depth descriptions of various maneuvers.

### General tips

- When you are in combat with a ship you are familiar with, try to get out of the turrets' line of sight. For example, when fighting a [Stormbringer]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Stormbringer) you would want to go underneath it, because it has no [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) underneath it, so the Turrets on top can't hit you.
- Always keep moving as fast as you can when fighting as it lowers the chance of an enemy hitting you.
- However, if you're looking to get big hits in dog fights don't always fly like a complete maniac, try lowering your throttle to get more hits. A dogfight is when you're using small, fast ships with [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) as their main weapons, such as the _[Zero]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zero)_, _[Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing)_ or any [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters)-Class ship.
- Make sure to use your Spinal Weapons (F and G guns) during combat for a huge damage bonus.
- When using [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) make sure the bottom of the cursor is facing the top of the ship, if the target is moving sideways, remember to lead the target by aiming in front of them and estimating where the Spinals will hit.
- Use your Q, E, C, and Z controls to move in a path making aiming and maneuverability easier. Best used for dog fights.
- When fighting in and/or against larger ships, be sure to avoid enemy [Spinal Weapons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and try to position yourself to maximize your firepower. Also, it is wise to avoid enemy [Turret]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) fire. Larger ships turn slower, so therefore, if you position yourself behind and below it, you can effectively start racking up damage before they can turn and engage you.
- Always rotate your ship correctly so all/most of your [Turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) get the line of sight with on your target. If you are using an [Apocalypse]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Apocalypse) or [Naglfar]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Naglfar), all Turrets could fire if the top of your ship is facing the target but, if your starboard were facing the target, only half of the Turrets could fire.
- Try to stay out of combat when your shields are down. Shields slowly regenerate, but hull does not. You can repair your hull by docking at a friendly [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).
- Never attack a Starbase alone unless you are experienced and have a powerful [Sieging Ship]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}siege-ships).
- Pay attention to the [Minimap]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Minimap), the last thing you need while in the middle of a battle is to have enemy reinforcements arrive. However, if a fellow faction or ally's reinforcements arrive, you have a great advantage over the opposing ship(s). Simply watching the Minimap can be the difference between loss and survival.
- When using fast ships like a [Scythe]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Scythe) or [Guillotine]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Guillotine), move at full speed. Warp at the enemies and fire when in range. Be sure to keep moving at maximum speed to make for an easier escape.
- Always check the diplomacy tab, never be caught off guard.
- Never mine in a war. No, seriously, don't. I have seen someone do it during a siege, 3 Loyalists ripped his Rorqual apart, even when he docked. This will cause you to lose a valuable miner ship, and make you start all over. Stealth ships might also want to sneak up to you if you mine also, beware!

### Combat maneuvers

#### Orbit

The most basic flight maneuver is to orbit your opponent and fly in circles around each other, trying to get into a blind spot if possible. Also, sometimes only one player will orbit and the second one will be in the middle trying to turn in place and keep up with the orbit of the first one.

#### Drifting

<div id=“Drifting”>
</div>

Drifting is what usually sets the noobs apart from the pros. Drifting might take some time to learn and you won't always get a perfect drift every time. There are two ways to drift: Fixed velocity, or dynamic. Fixed drifting is more common and easier to do. To drift on a fixed velocity, start at a good speed and hold <kbd>W</kbd>. When you find the direction you want your ship to travel while you drift, hit either <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>E</kbd> depending on which way you want to drift (<kbd>Q</kbd> to drift facing right, <kbd>E</kbd> to drift facing left.) While drifting, you are free to point wherever you want as long as you hold <kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>E</kbd>. Your ship will continue to drift in the direction you pointed to at the start of the drift. In order to drift dynamically, it's best to start at top speed and click, note click not drag, a certain point 90 degrees from your current velocity. Immediately after clicking, press and hold <kbd>Q</kbd> or <kbd>E</kbd>. What sets this apart from fixed velocity is you have the ability to orbit around your target. This is because unlike fixed velocity, when you drift dynamically, your direction is adjusted by your entire flight path changing to accommodate the new direction, keeping you always facing 90 degrees off your current path. To turn while drifting, continue holding q/e and click a new point of focus. If you don't understand that just try for yourself and it will eventually make sense. ![Example of drifting (Note: When drifting
starts, speed bar on the left turns
orange).](Drifting.mov "Example of drifting (Note: When drifting starts, speed bar on the left turns orange).") While drifting, two patterns usually arise from the fight-Orbiting and Sliding. Orbit occurs when both players are drifting in the same direction making them revolve around a certain point. Sliding occurs when both fighters slide in one collective direction in two parallel lines, this is usually easier to sustain than orbit because neither party needs to turn, meaning they cannot overdrift and collapse the distance in between them. Drifting is a very effective siege method if you are using a small fast ship with a decent hull hp because the orbital lasers will usually be the only thing able to hit you.

There is a statistic in all ships called **Drift Percentage** found via the /info (Ship) command _(e.g [Zero]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zero) has 70% Drift)_. This drift percentage dictates the max speed the ship can go through while drifting _(e.g A Drifting [Zero]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Zero) can only have a max speed of 80.5 due to it's drift percentage.)_.

There is also a variant of drifting called Z/C Drifting where the keys Z and C replace Q and E while drifting. This is done by turning your ship 90 Degrees from its axis then doing the same steps as a normal drift, but with Z and C instead. This makes your ship drift at full speed regardless of its drift percentage, but it may be more difficult to orbit around enemies when using this drift variant.

All [Fighter-class]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) ships have a 90% Drift Percentage, while some ships have 100% Drift percentage, like the [Helios]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Helios), these ships have the ability to drift properly while losing no speed.

#### Weaving

Since most ships have all their turrets on top and no underside defense what usually happens is orbit will start followed by a downward weaving pattern where both players will slowly spiral downwards trying to get under each other. This is where turn speed becomes an important attribute as a high turn speed means your orbit will be tighter so you can lap your opponent and come up behind and below them and wreak havoc.

#### Micro-Warping

Mirco warping is usually employed during a dread 1v1 or in a fight where spinals are the biggest source of DPS. What it is, is warping 400-1k and turning around to try to get behind your opponent in an orbiting fight or turning to deliver a head-on spinal attack. What also might happen, is a warp and flip. What that means, is after you warp to gain a bit of distance, you turn upwards so that all your topside turrets can get a line of sight at the enemy behind you. Mirco warping can also be used when your opponent is drifting in a spinal based ship. By warping right behind or next to them, you force them to stop drifting and spare yourself from the spinal fire for a few seconds. Micro Warping hard counters drifting if you opponent is spinal based, and you are turret based.

#### Other 1v1 Maneuvers

- **Counter Orbit:** When you find that your opponent is running circles around you in an orbiting battle, stop, and start turning the other way. Hopefully, they have too much momentum to stop before being right in front of you ready to take spinal punishment.
- **Ram:** If you are a [spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) based ship and your opponent is going too fast for you, forget all flight patterns and head-on attack and try to make them bump you so they stop moving and you are facing them with spinals blazing.
- **Blindspot Pirating:** If you have a ship with fast turn speed and decent [turrets]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}turrets), and are fighting a ship with only topside Turrets and slower turn speed, get underneath them and focus on staying below rather than getting all your turrets to hit or hitting your [spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}spinals). Since they can't hit you with any turrets or any spinals, eventually they will be forced to warp out, at which point you can unload all your fury upon them.
- **Tornado:** The Tornado maneuver can easily take down a slow ship when used by a skilled pilot. It involves constantly running circles around the enemy ship, while still facing it so spinals can hit it, as well as getting some turret shots. Note this strategy should be used by ships like the [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) that have high [spinal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) firepower.
- **Border Blocking:** Border blocking strategy is depended the pvp you are in. If your opponents turrets are top mounted go down to the border and stay there. Hopefully their ship won't be able to turn fast enough and you will get the kill. This strategy is useful against ships like Apocalypse and Nemesis.

### Retreating/Evasive Maneuvers

Galaxy is a game where not every scenario is winnable, and it is a sign of experience to know when to fight, and when to get the hell out before you are too low to save yourself. When retreating in a fleet be aware that if the enemy is not diving someone, the last person to warp will likely get the hell beaten out of them before leaving.

These maneuvers detail how to evade enemies. They are best used by ships of the [Cruiser]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}cruisers) class and under (although some [Battlecruisers]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battlecruisers) like the [Black Flare]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Black-Flare) can use a handful of these methods)

#### Duck and Dive

This maneuver consists of flying up and down repetitively while still maintaining a particular heading. This up-down motion makes it much more difficult for enemy spinals and turrets to hit while still allowing you to reach your destination. This can only be done with a smaller, faster ship as large warships such as Dreadnoughts won't be able to move fast enough to do any good.

#### Bob and Weave

A method based more on luck than skill. Best used at close range, this maneuver consists of random slips, turns, dives, acceleration, and deceleration as to make it incredibly difficult for enemies to get into a good firing position. Pilots performing this maneuver may become lucky enough as to get behind the enemy, allowing for an excellent tactical position.

#### Hull Skimming

A maneuver used to hide from and confuse enemies. A pilot performing this maneuver would stay incredibly close along the hull of another ally ship or base and would continuously work to avoid enemies from gaining a tactical advantage and a good firing position by keeping themselves out of sight.

### 1v1s

Most 1v1s can be won if you know what your doing of you have a ship that counters your opponent. The thing is, if your opponent is more skilled or has, say, a [Prowler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prowler) vs your [Cutlass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cutlass), you may want to get out ASAP. Class can make a difference but depending on skill a destroyer can kill a battleship so you need to know how good you are and have a general idea of how good your opponent is. **Note: While score might not be an accurate representation of skill, it is wise to proceed with caution around high scores. Bounty on the other hand, is a sign of an experienced and careful fighter.**

### 2v1s

Most 2v1s are a no-win situation, though there are exceptions. If your scenario is not on the following list, or you think that you are under the "enemy" category in a fleet of two, it would be smart to run.

**You have a counter to your enemies' ships:** If you are, for example, flying a [Prowler]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prowler) to fight a [Cutlass]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cutlass) and a [Marauder]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Marauder), you stand a chance because your primarily hull dps can kill the two hull tanks and you still stand a chance at winning. Another example is flying an [Aeaphiel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aeaphiel) to fight an [Archeon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Archeon) and a [Centurion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Centurion). In contrast to you having dps that counters your opponents' hp, now you have hp that counters your opponents' dps. That particular match up might be a bit harder to win simply because the Aeaphiel is a battlecruiser vs a battleship and a destroyer. This also applies to fighting swarms with an AA ship like the [Ampharos]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ampharos) or the [Loyalist]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Loyalist).

**When your enemies are using two much weaker vessels:** This seems kind of intuitive, but a dread should usually be able to take out a pair of frigates despite its low accuracy. This also applies when your enemies have very low hp but high dps since you can kill them quickly before the damage starts to hurt.

## Fleets

The term "fleet" is generally used to refer to large groups of player-coordinated ships. Fleets can be used for sieging, defense, economic blockades during war, and more. This section details the basics of fleets and fleet coordination.

### Fleet Basics

Let us start with the basics; You are on a two faction server, 20v20 players, and on the map, you see a rather angry blob of triangles, which represent your opposing faction's most active area. In this situation, you want to stick as close as possible to the area the most of your team's ships are. If you are on your own in a relatively low DPS/support ship, and you are not covered by any [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or are within easy reach of the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), you are probably going to get spotted by a rather high DPS ship or group of rather high DPS ships and promptly dived on and destroyed within a minute of combat, or after a few jumps. You want to stay with your fleet, and only venture from it if you know:

1.  You will have the fleet to go back to if you are counter-attacked.
2.  If you are sure you can get out of a fight if a large group of the enemy fleet splinters off to attack.
3.  If there is a good reason to, such as a freighter or smaller ship, which you can jump on, kill quickly, and regroup.

Next, while in the fleet, you need to realize a few important concepts: First, the concept of the **Tank**. The tank can be any ship, but it always is the ship which is focused or will be focused first. This could be a ship which a rather skilled player is in, and thus is a high priority target. This could be a vulnerable ship in your fleet, say an Avalon, which is either low health or already weak to begin with. This could be a ship with poor positioning and is right on top of where the enemy fleet warped in. The tank is the ship which is most likely to be targeted first by the greatest amount of people in a fleet, and if you can identify the tank in your fleet, you can play around that. If you are in a lighter ship, say a battlecruiser or smaller, you can let the fleet dive in on the poor tank, and pick off something in the backline, or perhaps if your fleet is focusing fire, on the ship with the most amount of DPS.

What if you are the Tank? Don't. If you are the tank because of the ship you are in, repair or switch it out to something more bulky. If you can't, you **have**to watch your health bar. Once you get around half [Shields]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Shields), which should take a short amount of time, you need to warp away from the fight, around 5-10k, and reengage. This spreads out the damage on the fleet and is how you counter focus fire. In order to keep DPS on a single ship they will have to warp after said ship, and that temporarily makes them unable to be in combat while they warp. Consider it this way, 3 v 3 with [Dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts). If one team continuously focused on one of the other Dreadnoughts, while that other Dreadnought simply warped 5k every time, and the 3 Dreadnoughts followed. They would take a considerable amount of damage from the other 2 Dreadnoughts, as they are trying to focus on the ship. That is why it doesn't happen. If you continuously cycle out who is the tank, with whoever else is the tank at the time of warping out and re-engaging every time they lose half shields, you end up in a position where you have spread the damage among 3 ships, while you have focused on one of their ships to where they had run away, and the other two also.

Finally, for fleet basics, you must understand another concept: Galaxy players, especially good ones, know when to back off or go all in, with the better the player, the sooner they get the hell out of dodge when their odds aren't looking too good. Some players, however, will react differently if the enemy team has a ship that is hulled and of value: they may dive it no matter what, even if it means warping closer to the enemy base. Most galaxy players **will** warp out of a fight if they are put onto hull, and this is where communication becomes vital. You need to figure out where the player which you hulled is warping to, what support they will have, and how quick they can despawn their ship or warp to a more advantageous position. Because you will rarely have the firepower to kill a hulled dreadnought before it can dock or warp away, you need friends to warp with you and do as much damage as possible. If you, do it right, and plan accordingly, you will be getting many kills, because fleet combat rarely plays out to where there are multiple casualties, full fleet combat is a way to isolate a target and get a kill.

### Fleet Coordination

A fleet is a very desirable thing, for the sheer amount of firepower they can possess and pump out, for the amount of safety they tend to provide against wandering battleships and dreadnoughts, or even for the value and satisfaction of working as a team to complete a goal. However, to get one is difficult at the best of times, and impossible in others, simply due to the fact that you can't get everyone to agree on one given thing, especially if they don't know you. However, there is a way, or a few ways, to get coordination online in any given server.

1.  **Use of in game Communications** - While the in-game chat service can at certain times best be described as using a light version of Morse code to communicate with a blind man. It does work most of the time, just not always. Under most circumstances, by simply typing in team chat (by doing the command /t and typing normally), you can at least get one determined person to group up with you, and perhaps follow orders.
2.  **Use of External Services** - This tends to be a more reliable way of communication. Simply hook up the team you are in with a hangout server for, say, Discord, and you suddenly have the speed and efficiency of a mic for use in organization. The only problem is, not many people have Discord, and it is slightly difficult to set up.
3.  **Use of Groups Centered Around Galaxy** - This is the absolute best way to get a fleet going. Simply join a Discord group, get a few people online, join a server and a mic channel, and have fun. Usually, other members of a group will treat each other well and follow good advice, just be prepared for the occasional misconception.

Next, there are a few things you must consider while in a fleet and while commanding a fleet:

1.  You must have a fallback plan. Have somewhere everyone knows where to warp to when crap inevitably hits the fan.
2.  Warp at roughly the same time, and in the same place. Use the distances specified in the warp menu rather than the exact one if it will mean the whole fleet warps in on target.
3.  Specify the most dangerous threat on another team and get people to target them. If you want to bring this to another level, have shield breaker ships (ships which are mainly anti-shield) target shielded ships while you have hull breaker ships (ships which counter hull) target and dive hulled enemies.
4.  Have a balanced fleet. Be sure to have shield breaking capabilities as well as hull breaking capabilities, with a healthy mix of ships which can dive.

If you keep your caravan of high-grade weapon transported in working order as specified, you will have a fun time. Try and be polite to one another while in fleet combat, curtsy is usually the best way to get an idea up and fast in a fast-paced situation. Any idea is usually better than inactivity.

### Advanced Tactics

#### Fighter Swarming

Fighter swarming is a method to attack bases, destroy ships or carry out dogfights due to the extremely high firepower all combined fighters of a [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) or a Starbase usually has. This can be done with AI Fighters, though it is of much greater efficacy if it is controlled by players instead.

#### Crossteaming (clan trapping)

Sometimes, when you have enough connections and firepower, you may crossteam with another powerful player to score a high value kill. This is commonly known as Clan Trapping. Pretend that you and your friend are at war with each other by pretending to be fighting with a shiny Super Capital or two. You may choose to be stationary around one spot or enact a scene of warp chasing, making your target fall for your trick. Once your true target falls for the bait and warp to the scene, both you and your friend should turn on them immediately and get that high valued kill. It is recommended that you only clan trap with very high firepower Dreadnoughts (Retro Prototype X-1, Obliterator and etc.) or Super Capitals (such as the [Theia]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Theia) due to its great firepower, or even Prototypes. This trick is fantastic for targeting someone and most people that had never experienced this will likely fall for this easily.

#### Ghost team (Logoff trapping)

Have a friend or two stay at your team for a while until they get at least 7% Loyalty. Have them leave the server. Declare war on your target's faction while being solo. Your target might get complacent and not shy away from going after you. Go somewhere and let yourself get attacked by your target, pretend to be low and warp back to your base and let yourself get dived. Have your friends join back at that exact moment and spawn their big ships, because loyalty persists as long as its the same team even though you've left the server. And then annihilate your target.

#### Multiboxing

<s>Multi-boxing or multiboxing refers to playing as multiple separate accounts/players concurrently in a game. These separate accounts are often called alt (alternate) accounts, or just alts</s> **Due to a recent announcement said by Roblox Staff, multiboxing is now considered "malicious activity" and is now bannable and prones your account to termination. This will not be enforced by Galaxy Staff, but if Roblox catches you, you will most likely be subject to consequences. Any multiboxing strategies below this point may be bannable.**

It is advised to not attempt to multi-box on lower-end devices, as it may result in your device crashing

##### Applications of Multi-boxing

- People may enjoy making whole swarms of ships by themselves.
- Makes farming easier.
- It allows the multi-boxer to have a source of backup as and when they require.
- Can spy other team chats.
- Can be especially effective in sieging.

**Advantages**

- It is easier to grind on different accounts if you're multi-boxing as compared to logging on to each individual account and grinding.
- It provides a source of backup for the multi-boxer, especially if the multi-boxer's alts have [battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships) or even [dreadnoughts]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}dreadnoughts).
- Allows efficient kills as a multi boxer knows where and when to warp all ships rather than relying on people who may either not warp at the same time or have bad warping.
- It allows the multi-boxer to make full use of a carrier's fighters, assuming that the multi-boxer does not have AI fighters, especially carriers with low number of fighters ([Vanguard]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vanguard), [Executioner]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Executioner), [Prometheus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Prometheus) etc.)
- It allows the multi-boxer to have spies in other factions' chats, and give them an upper hand in combat.

**Disadvantages**

- Players may be unable to multi-box efficiently on lower-end devices, as the clients may lag excessively or even crash.
- Multi-boxing is not a feature supported by Roblox, Apple, Microsoft or any other large tech company. As such, wannabe multi-boxers must be sure that they install the correct multi-boxing software and not a Trojan disguised as one.
- It requires practice to be able to control your alts, especially once you have 3 or more active at once.

##### Methods for Multi-boxing

There are several methods for multi-boxing, and each one is unique in its own way. Some methods may be viable for certain players, whereas it may not be for others.

**Using Multiple Devices to Multi-box**

Using more than one computer is always an option, especially for individuals with an old computer lying around, which may not have anything better to be doing then rusting in a closet. While this may be a luxury for most players, some have the extra laptops sitting around to do this, and it is probably the simplest of the three to get working. Simply have another Roblox account, download Roblox for that computer, and start playing on both computers at once. This has the disadvantages of requiring multiple computers being already in your possession, and that it may be more difficult to cycle through both computers as they run. However, people with several weaker computers can execute this well enough if they can't do the below strategies, and it works well enough for what it is.

**Using the Microsoft Version to Multi-box**

Players using Windows have a way of having two Roblox games open at the same time, with little fuss. As part of Microsoft's push to become a gaming hub, they offer Roblox as an application on their store, which uses different software from the Roblox you may normally download online. Because of this, having both installed means you can play both the web version, and the Microsoft Store version on the same computer. This means you now have two Roblox applications open. This can be combined with with multi-computer multi-boxing if you do not wish to bother with the third type of multi-boxing. **To be clear, this option is only functional if you are using Windows 10 or Windows 11.**

**Using Third-party Software**

This is the most common, and riskiest, method of multi-boxing. Third party multi-boxing allows you to open as many instances as your computer can handle. Many third-party applications are rather sketchy and flagged by antivirus software. It is recommended for players who do decide to use this path to ask around with more experienced players to learn which are safe and which aren't. Some third-party applications may also be Trojan-ware disguised as multi-boxing software.

The following are a few tools for multi-boxing on Roblox. **Please note that these (exception of #3) are not created by or officially endorsed by Galaxypedia Staff.**

- [WeAreDevs Multiple Games](https://wearedevs.net/d/Multiple%20Games) **This page has advertisements which are likely to link to malware. Make sure to click the correct download button.**
- [Roblox Account Manager](https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager) allows you to manage accounts and prevents old Roblox instances from closing when launching new ones.
- [RobloxHandleCloser](https://github.com/Wingysam/RobloxHandleCloser) is created by Galaxypedia Head Staff member yname. It is safe to use but is complicated to set up.
- [Asmoww MultiClient](https://github.com/Asmoww/MultiClient)

**Force Quitting on MacOS**

This technique is a bit harder to implement due to Apple devices having poor gaming specs but if your Macbook is powerful enough, you could pull this off. This would involve opening an instance of Roblox and then navigating to the apple icon on the top toolbar. Once you have selected the icon, a force quit option will appear. Once that is open, you will force quit Roblox then run it again. An error message will appear but you can close the game. Re-open the game and then you can log off your main account and log on to as many alt accounts you need. The main advantage for this bug is that you do not need to rely on third-party software, and can open multiple instances of the game on different accounts.

##### Tips for Multi-boxing

- Learn to Alt + Tab. It is considerably faster to alt tab between your alts than it is to select them from the toolbar menu.
- Use a macro to switch between tabs, as it is faster than Alt + Tab. The most popular macro for this, written in AutoHotKey, is available [here](https://gist.github.com/Wingysam/3c9c12998b5a34c192e94905f092f616). Once you use this, you will need [another macro](https://gist.github.com/Wingysam/30c74b616fcf636fc8dbfd4766a75446) to use turrets.

**Performance**

- Close any tabs that are unnecessary to save on RAM and processing power
- Turn down the graphics for each account to reduce the amount of processing power needed
- Use [rbxfpsunlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker) to limit your frame rate to 30. This will drastically reduce the processing power required to run the instances of Roblox. **This is not created by or officially endorsed by Galaxypedia staff, but is generally known to be safe.** "At the engineering panel on day 1 of RDC 2019, Adam Miller, VP of Engineering & Technology at Roblox, made a personal guarantee that anyone using Roblox FPS Unlocker will not be banned from Roblox."

## Sieges

### Sieging an Enemy Starbase

These strategies detail how to destroy an enemy [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).

To find out what ships will be the most useful in your situation look at their Shapes, DPS, Health, Turret Placement, Alpha Damage, and Speed to see if it will help with your situation.

#### Classic Siege

The most common method of destroying an enemy [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase).

Uses a lot of Battleships, Battlecruisers, Cruisers, and Dreadnoughts. Heavier ships with [Railguns]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) and [Heavy Lasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Turrets) attack the Starbase and any heavy ships that retaliate, smaller, lighter ships provide evasive cover and make sure nothing gets close to the heavier ships. The main idea of this type of siege is to brute-force their way into destroying the enemy Starbase.

#### Torpedo Siege

Uses a ship or two with extremely powerful [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and strong long-range capabilities, such as the [Hasatan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hasatan), [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon) [Ridgebreaker]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ridgebreaker) or the [Hyperion]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hyperion), along with multiple other Dreadnoughts or Battleships that are capable of tanking and long-range attack, and at least one large ship optimized for PvP such as the [Hawklight]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hawklight). This is an extremely effective siege strategy but it requires some timing and can fail miserably if messed up bad enough. This siege strategy goes for dealing massive damage at a long range, then finishing it off by pushing forward and focus-firing on the Starbase. Once the Starbase's shields are depleted, it deals significant hull damage.

#### Outside the Box

(This strategy works only for enemy [Starbases]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) close to the edge of the map).

This strategy uses any ship with extremely high range (7k+). Ships like the [Hasatan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hasatan), [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon), or [Andromeda]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Andromeda) are best. Said ship needs to nearly go outside of the map. The ship needs to go as far up as possible without taking boundary damage, this helps with hiding from the enemy. The [Hasatan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hasatan) then shoots as many Torpedoes as possible before getting spotted and running away. If the ship does not destroy the enemy Starbase before being caught, a "Classic Seige" or a "Torpedo Siege" can easily finish off the job. This strategy is very effective if done right and can cripple and destroy even the strongest of enemy bases, the only downside being you need a specific circumstance and it's surprisingly hard to hit your target.

(Addendum: with the addition of the new warp mechanics, ships are no longer able to warp while outside the map. This places a great deal of risk on operating the Outside The Box strategy.)

(Another Note: As of a recent update, the map was greatly expanded and it's now even less likely for a starbase to spawn within 7k distance of a boundary, further limiting the possibilities of the Outside the Box Strategy).

#### Fighter Siege

First, park any [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) outside the base range (9k-11k) alongside a sieging fleet. Use the [Fighters]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) to distract base fire so your ships can stay within range and fire upon the Starbase. Make sure at least 3 guys are manning the fighters, and at least 2 [Battleships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}battleships). In order to do this correctly have 1-2 people in [Sixfolds]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) or [Cobras]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra) to shoot down enemy fighters or ships. If you do this correctly, none of the ships in your fleet except for the Fighters will get damaged.

#### Flash Fleet

A tactic used to catch the enemy by surprise. (The enemy Starbase has to be somewhat close to the edge of the map).

This strategy is very similar to "Outside the Box" except instead of just a [Hasatan]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Hasatan) there is a fleet, imagine a "Classic Seige" or a "Torpedo Siege" except off radar. How this strategy works is by having ships sneak out of the map (doesn't allow the radar to see you). A [Carrier]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}carriers) would be good for this because it's just a single ship, but it can deploy a fleet. It can be suspicious if multiple ships go out of the map at the same time. Because of this, each ship will have to go out of the map every minute or so as to avoid detection. From there you can launch the attack, catch them all off guard, and destroy their Starbase.

#### Drop Firing

This tactic should be used along with the strategies for sieging. Doing this alone will result in low damage being done and a few dead ships if you're not careful.

Use small ships that have a lot of [Spinals]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). Lowest amount is four small phasers or cannons. Ships such as the [Viper]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Viper) are alright for damaging shields. [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) is good for hull destruction. [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing) Is also a good all-rounder since it has both [Cannons]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals) and [Phasers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Spinals). Repeatedly do flybys of the base, damaging it each time. You can also bring in some [Phantom's]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Phantom) to help kill shield because of the lasers on the bottom. Again, do NOT attempt to use this strategy alone. This is a strategy that is to be used with another.

#### Alien Supporters

This strategy is generally unreliable, but it could be useful. You need a [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) and group of [Swarmers]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) for this to work. First, the Aliens need to attack the enemy Starbase. This step is challenging because it's hard to lead Aliens to a specific place. Once the Aliens are at the enemy's Starbase, the Aliens will attack whatever the [Punisher]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Aliens) does, causing trouble for any players the Punisher's AI might target. After the Aliens have either retreated or died, the Starbase will most likely be low on health, or dead entirely. This strategy is generally one that isn't used since the Punisher might target one of your sieging ships, causing critical damage. If this strategy is used, its best to wait for all the Aliens to die, otherwise you are putting yourself in a risky position.

#### Nuking

Take any large ship like an M-class, Dreadnoughts, etc. and drive it straight at the enemy base. Get as close as you can to the base and let it destroy you. When your ship explodes, the explosion might take the enemy base down with you and will damage any nearby ships. Some good ships for nuking are Nyx, Galaxy, etc. However, using these ships are not recommended unless you are in arcade, since these ships are also generally immensely expensive in the regular version of the game.

#### Long-Range Siege

Take any ship that has a turret with a high range and a lot of damage like an [Xenon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Xenon), [Lazarus]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Lazarus), [Andromeda]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Andromeda), Super Capital Ships, etc. and drive it 8000--6000 studs away from the enemy base, then attack the base.

### Defense Against Sieges

These strategies are used for defending against an enemy or countering some of the siege tactics listed above.

#### Fleet in Being

This tactic is aimed at showing off military power while not leaving the base.  Players will spawn in large [Ships]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Ships) or combat vessels as to show off military power and make itself a threat while not actually engaging in combat unless absolutely forced to. These ships will simply be docked at either their own Starbase or at the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base). Docking enough of these Ships at your own starbase might influence enemy decisions and can prevent sieges. This will also help prevent [Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) if done at [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base).

#### Dock Camping

This strategy is highly effective when used in a situation where the enemy team has a clear advantage and you and your team are not willing to lose any ships but still want to defend your team. Your team will pick your most heavily armed base (Often the [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership) or a high-level planet) but a [Level 4 Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) can work depending on your enemies strength) and dock your ships there. But can be used to defend any base just be ready to despawn if your ship's health runs too low. If it gets too damaged go to the strongest base and see if it is safe to spawn it and heal there but despawn it if enemies come by unless it is healed enough.

Keep your team's best and strongest ships docked at your best base using it as a mega stronghold. The combination of your best bases turrets and your best ships docked at the base is sure to cause trouble for the attackers. Keeping your ships docked or very close is crucial, the point is to despawn your ship when it is too low (not risking losing your ship). **IT IS VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO BE LURED OUT OF YOUR BASE RANGE BY AN ENEMY SHIP. THIS IS OFTEN A TRAP.**

This strategy can often take a lot of time. You need to wait for your enemy to decide to attack you which may not happen for 1--2 hours or more (any intelligent team will clearly see the difficulty and risk). When they do attack, it is very important that your team **coordinates which ship to destroy and attack the same ship**, this is important because you want to destroy the ship fast or it will just warp away and heal up. You and your team want to slowly take out the fire from a fleet by targeting the big ships one by one. If a ship gets away **NEVER CHASE.**

This strategy requires a loyal team willing to be very patient, and a number of ships/players similar to your enemies. This is commonly used and learned by players on their own but was added by Hamlet9219.

#### What to Shoot

This tactic is a very uncommon one. This requires a decent-sized team that has members willing to co-operate. You need a [Level-3 Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) or a Carrier to apply this.

First, when you realize that a siege will occur, tell all your team members to get in a [Fighter]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}fighters) that spawns on the base's hangar or in the carrier. And you yourself get your most powerful PvP ship. The speed of it doesn't matter much. When you have a PvP ship and a squadron of fighters. When the enemy ships come, it will be hard for them to choose which one to attack. Fighters? The PvP? Or the starbase?

If they attack Fighters, the PvP ship and the base lasers will take them down slowly while the ships that are good for sieges, which have inaccurate turrets will be taking more than five minutes to destroy the small Fighters.

They attack the PvP ship, then the small but many Fighters will kill at least two of the siegers and the base will take the other.

If the siegers attack the base, you will get the worst result out of all three options of theirs. But still, you won't get the base destroyed if you didn't make a critical mistake. Continuing on, If they attack the starbase, the PvP ship will destroy the first sieger in less than 45 seconds. While the fighters have finished the other one, all of you destroy the last one together and get your bounties.

Another chance is that the reinforcements will arrive for the enemy team. Even if it happens, which is unlikely for their team members have seen what happened to the most powerful ones. The ships they will bring probably will be weak, So it's unlikely they will even get a chance to shoot at the base among the crowd of the small ships.

#### Defensive Swarm

Swarm involves everyone on the team using a ship that is fast and can deal a lot of damage, preferably a ship like the [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold), or another Cruiser. All of the ships then will target one ship at a time, either scaring it off and forcing it to warp, or destroying it. It's typically good to make sure your team is out of the ships' lines of sight, or the Starbase is being shot at by them.

By doing this, you can either delay a siege or completely stop one. However, some drawbacks are your team won't want to coordinate or doesn't want to risk their small ships for defense.

#### Ambush

While having a few tanky capital ships defending the base from the attacks head-on, other players can teleport to different bases like the [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base) or any other capped starbase (if any) and spawn ships from there.

If capital ships are available, hard-hitting ones will be a better choice than tankier ones due to the enemy targeting the defending fleet and the base these ships could be [Avalon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Avalon), [Nemesis]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nemesis), [Tempest]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Tempest), [Jackal]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Jackal) and any hull breaker due to the starbases shield focus weaponry.

If Capital ships aren't available, then spawn a fleet of non-capital but hard hitting ships, this includes [Razor Wing]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Razor-Wing), [Belvat]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Belvat), [Vansnova]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Vansnova), [Absolution]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Absolution), [Dramiel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Dramiel), [Arthur]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Arthur) and [Sentinel]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sentinel).

#### Peekaboo

A minimum of two bases (at least one being level 2) is required for this, preferably the [Mothership]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mothership) and main starbase. Have one player go to the main starbase and spawn a cruiser/battlecruiser. The rest of the team will remain at the other base and WILL NOT spawn any ships. At this point, it is likely that the enemies will siege the main starbase because of its strategic importance and the opportunity for a kill. When the siege has begun, the team at the other base will spawn multiple battleships and a dreadnought if possible. Then this team will warp to the main starbase. This should happen very quickly, preferably in the timespan of 30 seconds. The siege team will be unprepared and will be destroyed easily. This strategy is largely based on chance, so it should only be used as a last resort.

#### Revenge from the Grave

Allow the enemy to siege your base with little resistance, and then pull off a heavily guarded 'Classic Siege' or 'Torpedo Siege' on theirs from another base. The enemies will retreat and attempt to destroy your fleet. Warp away as soon as the enemy warps near you. If they siege again, they will likely split their forces, leaving some ships at their base. Their forces are now stretched thin. Spawn a massive fleet at an obsolete level 2 base that is not being attacked, let's call this fleet A, and destroy the defending force on their side. Wait for the enemy siege team to return to the base and destroy them too. Siege their base with fleet A and now that you do not have to defend yourself anymore, you can spare more ships.

#### Logoff Trap: Siege Edition

Do the same thing, have yourself and a friend or two stay at a team and get at least 7% Loyalty. Declare war against the biggest teams on the server and then leave the server. Put a low score alt onto the team to watch how everything goes. When the teams siege your base, join the server with your friends then spawn all your shiny powerful ships and take your enemies by surprise. This is best done with Super Capitals and have your friends on separate teams so that multiple Super Capitals may be used to achieve maximum damage. Target the most valuable ship to get the most out of this, as the server is likely never going to fall for this again for the next 3 or 4 hours.

## Money Making

**Galaxy has many ways to make money, each with advantages and disadvantages. Knowing when and how to work for credits will greatly help you progress in Galaxy. Each tab details a specific strategy for making money.**

### Mining

Mining is slower than trading, but also much safer (assuming that you mine around your own base). Miners fuel the economy and help to keep it alive. Because miners are not armed well; they can be a big target; so it's best to keep your miner around your own base - this also helps reduce travel time between ore fields and your Starbase. **More info can be found in the page [Mining]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mining).**

**Advantages**

- The payment is consistent with the fixed prices of the Mega Base and scarce economies of Starbases.
- Ores can spawn inside turret range relative to the base, especially in newer factions, meaning mining is sometimes risk-free.
- The ores harvested through mining can be sold for more than the base paid for them, meaning if you then sell them to another base (or the Mega Base), you can make a lot of money for your faction - this is the primary source of income for most Starbases, and the foothold of a developed faction.
- Mining is the best way to accumulate thousands of a specific ore inside a Starbase to gradually lower the price of that ore for a profit.
- Always available.

**Disadvantages**

- Ores can sometimes be very far from the base, especially in older factions, or if you're exclusively mining a single ore in order to try to lower its price.
- When mining far from the base, it can sometimes not be possible to get back to your base within the 90 second grace period before a war begins.
- Miners will have a harder time dealing with enemies such as aliens, as they have little firepower to deal with them.
- Pirates may declare war on you wanting to destroy your miner.
- Uranium is rather rare or nonexistent in some public servers, so it cannot be consistently mined.
- Bases can't have negative credits anymore, so you need to wait for your base to gain enough credits before you can sell your ore. Until then it is better to transfer your ore into your warehouse.
- !!! Ores no longer spawn if there are only 2 teams left on the server during endgame.

### Combat Rewards

Combat Rewards is a way of making money by damaging and destroying ships. **Tips and Tricks**

- **This is the most dangerous way to make money and is NOT recommended for newer players.**
- If you are new and want to try making money through combat rewards, starting off with Kneall Swarmers and alien bruisers as a start to learning basic combat, just be sure not to lose your ship!
- Be in a team with a sizable fleet, that way you and your teammates can take down large ships with much more ease. Teamwork is key to success.
- If sieging, stay close to your team's fleet or the enemy may target you for being alone.
- Follow your fleet commander's orders, they will have a plan of the bigger picture - It's not worth it.
- Don't take on larger ships by yourself unless you are in a ship of the same class - check the minimap frequently in case their teammates are waiting to strike you after taking damage.
- War is much more common in larger servers, especially with the presence of coordinated factions.
- Joining servers in Endgame will have done the territorial heavy lifting for you, filtering only the strongest factions into the end.

**Advantages**

- Gets you more familiarized with the game's unique ships and current meta.
- Teaches you how to properly fight against another player, which is amazing knowledge to have in this game.
- Unlike mining or trading, combat rewards aren't grindy and are a fun way to make credits.
- Being in lots of fleets will teach you which players to avoid.
- Can be a great complement to what loot enemies may have, especially for bosses such as the Kodiak, which can reward quest materials and credits.

**Disadvantages**

- If not experienced, you will lose large amounts of credits through ship destruction.
- Requires lots of skill and knowledge of the game's meta and your current server's climate.
- Players may hold a grudge towards you and target you if you were responsible for killing one of their valued ships.
- Most players will warp away once they're hulled, allowing your CR to diminish to nothing over time.
- If your ship is destroyed, the potential rewards will vanish.
- Loyalty takes time to gain.

### Vulturing

Vulturing is a way of gaining money by looting the remains of NPC or Player wrecks without contributing. This playstyle is normally utilized during events to which the value of NPC wrecks are high, owing to rare components or numerous materials.

The addition of instant loot shares through damage % (Commonly used with Boss NPCs or the [Kneall Stronghold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Kneall-Stronghold)), combined with team-specific loot access has made it harder than ever to steal someone else's hard work.

### Pirating

[Pirating]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Pirating) is a more dangerous way of making money, involving the destruction (and looting) of freighters and miners for money, and occasionally including claiming the bounty if the target had one. Pirates usually use small fast ships that can kill miners and freighters quickly without taking heavy damage from the base lasers. Common ships for pirating include the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra), [Sixfold]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Sixfold) and [Gideon]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Gideon), and wealthy pirates may use [Stealth Ships]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}stealth-ships) for some tasks. Pirates normally attack miners and freighters due to the fact that these ships are unarmed and are expensive, with freighters usually carrying a lot of additional loot in their cargo hold. Most pirates have a decent-sized bounty, making them fairly easy to spot.

Late game pirates who are more wealthy and familiar with the game often pick up common behaviors from certain players. Using all of this to their advantage they are able to pick out armed capital ships to pirate to gain even more wealth from the large wrecks Dreadnoughts and Carriers can leave behind. These pirates also can lay out a trap and specifically target something they lay eyes on to secure their goal and profit from it with the least casualty.

Many recommended ships for Pirating can be found in the page [Pirate Ships.]({{< ref "/categories/" >}}pirate-ships)

**Tips and Tricks**

- Ships as big as carriers and dreadnoughts can be targeted by pirates if the pirates are in a group, or if the dreadnoughts have just left a large battle, such as a base siege.
- Occasionally it can be profitable to lose a ship whilst pirating if you manage to kill your target, especially when the target has a bounty. (Using your own ship explosion can be a last resort in finishing off a deep-hulled target)
- As miners and freighters are often big and slow, spinal-based ships like the [Cobra]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Cobra) are good at taking them out.
- Cruisers like the [Nidhogg]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Nidhogg) can slowly use its spinals to pick off the miner or freighter's shields and use its flak cannons to easily finish off the ship.
- Taking the time to familiarize with the common behavior of certain and new players allows you to make better decisions and plan what you _can_ do.
- Stealth ships can be excellent for this purpose, as they can sneak up on unsuspecting players.

**Advantages**

- Pirating can be fairly easy when targeting miners stranding far from the safety of their base.
- The enemy ships are normally unarmed.
- Pirating can earn a sizeable combat reward if done right.
- Pirating is fairly cheap to start, as strong pirate ships are as simple as a Destroyer or Cruiser, such as the Cobra or Gideon.
- When using a small ship with warp, it is usually easy to escape if a large ship or base defends your target.
- Bounty is seen as a status symbol.

**Disadvantages**

- Pirates can sometimes be easy to spot due to decent bounty, losing you the element of surprise.
- Pirating requires a lot of patience.
- Players may remember you and may announce the fact that you're a pirate to others.
- You can cast the bait all day long and still nothing bites.
- Some players hold a grudge and want revenge.
- If failed miserably, you may lose your ship.
- Many players escape to their [Starbase]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Starbase) as soon as a war is declared, making it difficult to destroy them.
- The difference in precision between your and their warps can be the difference between life and death.

### Private Server Methods

Owning or having an access to a private server is the key to some of the best money making methods in the entire game. Millions of credits can be made in a single day if done properly.

#### Boss Hunting

Sit in a private server until a boss spawns, then kill and loot it.

**Advantages**

- You can be afk for most of the time.
- Completely risk free if you're alone, since you can shutdown the server to de-spawn your ship immediately before you're about to die.
- Nobody to share the loot with.

**Disadvantages**

- One of the least efficient ways of using a private server to farm credits.
- Not doable if you don't have the sufficient firepower or strategy.
- Can be dangerous if you're fighting against a Kodiak or Decimator and you're not alone.
- Takes quite a bit of time investment, as bosses don't spawn frequently.
- Combat reward diminishes by quite a lot if you require the help of a base, as its earned credits will go into the Starbase bank.

### Buying Credits

Buying credits is the easiest and fastest way to make money in-game. Nothing rivals how much money can be gained in a single click. Hundreds of thousands of credits can be made in just seconds.

**Advantages**

- The fastest and easiest way to make money in-game.
- You can be anywhere in-game and still be able to buy credits.

**Disadvantages**

- The price for credits costs an exorbitant amount of Robux, relative to the time it would take if you already own a Galaxy through mining or a Supercapital-Class through combat rewards.

### Patched Unintended Money Making Methods

#### <s>Battery Duping</s>

<s>Battery Duping Involves selling something to [Mega Base]({{< ref "/wiki/" >}}Mega-Base), often in Private Server then as soon as the servers all update and it shows up outside of your server, you have alts buy it on seperate servers, and if you're quick enough, the game sells you more materials than it actually has in stock. This can cause materials' stock to be in the negatives sometimes.</s>

#### <s>Shutdown Mining</s>

<s>Enter a private server, make a team, mine a full ore hold, then shutdown the server. You'll get around 50% more credits than the normal amount from automatic refund, and nobody knows why. But hey, its free money!</s>

Private servers have been removed alongside the transition to Galaxy Delta, erasing this method.
